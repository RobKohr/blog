        <p>For the last few years I have been using cloudflare in front of editthis.info. On the 21st I dropped it, and saw an immediate decrease in average load times (from google analytics):</p>
<p><img src="2020-09-22-15-12-53.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This was without any changes to the system at all, and with about 800-900 active users per day.</p>
<p>Also, as mentioned in my previous blog post, in cloudflare&#39;s dashboard, it reports a massive number of malicious attacks that they have thwarted.</p>
<p><img src="2020-09-21-10-26-35.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These are either inflated numbers, or more worrying actual users who couldn&#39;t get past their overly vigorous captcha screening process.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how this effects user counts overall - some could be from the speed boast and some from lack of captchas. In either case, I won&#39;t be using cloudfront again. I am going to set up a simple nginx proxy in front of the website, and implement some caching there to help increase the speed even further.</p>

        <p><a href="http://Editthis.info">EditThis.info</a> has long been overdue for an upgrade. I&#39;ve been postponing it for a while, and now that I have just finished a big move, a wedding, and a honeymoon in Disney (covid be damned), I am circling back on it.</p>
<p>Task list (this article will be updated as things are completed):</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Clone current server instance</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Remove cloudfront - it constantly causes problems, and I think it is blocking a lot of users worldwide that it considers &quot;malicious&quot;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Set dev.editthis.info to new server instance</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Add nginx with caching (this will hopefully fulfill the role of cloudflare better as I can customize it as needed)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> upgrade php</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> upgrade mediawiki<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Convert an absurd of dbs to the new mediawiki db structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Point editthis.info to new server</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way I expect a lot of hick-ups and course corrections, but EDI is a very active site despite it&#39;s poor network performance. I think it is reasonable to expect that with a bit of an overhaul I can achieve a 10x increase in usage, which would make it much more lively than it is now.</p>
<p>Screenshot showing how much cloudflare is blocking (basically a count of failed or skipped annoying captchas): <img src="2020-09-21-10-26-35.png" alt=""></p>
