        <p>I delved into svelte pretty deep to get a grasp of it. I decided to try to make a set of components similar to material UI, just focusing on form elements. </p>
<p>When it came to passing values, references, functions up and down the component stack, it just became much more difficult than doing it in React, which makes things pretty trivial.</p>
<p>I got hit with the feeling that I was just playing with magic that I didn&#39;t understand. </p>
<p>This past week I built two static sites for running my school board campaign using solidjs. It has some basic routing and property passing, so I haven&#39;t really given it a good trial yet, but so far it seems to be an easy stand in for React. I&#39;ll need to give it eventually the same sort of test I did with Svelte.</p>
<p>I have a desire to move to SolidJs to move away from some of the re-rendering inefficiencies and difficulties in passing values around in React.</p>
