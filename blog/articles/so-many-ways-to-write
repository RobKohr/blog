<p>I have gotten so interested in different writing systems lately. I have more notebooks than I know what to do with. I use a daily notebook.md file which I use to track work tasks. I have this blog, which is generated from a blog.md file. I recently got index cards and am trying to figure out how to incorporate them in some way.</p>
<p>Creating a pattern to writing is the tricky part. It takes repetition and a desire to do it... kinda like exercise.</p>
