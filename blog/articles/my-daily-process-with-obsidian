        <p>I have grown to love Obsidian, the notetaking app. </p>
<ul>
<li>I use it as a place to throw ideas that I don&#39;t have time to devote to. </li>
<li>I use it as a place to keep a daily task list that I keep up with about half the time</li>
<li>I use it to write this blog here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think about making a blogging app, but I like what I do. I have one long markdown file with articles separated by headers and with some date and tags added to it. </p>
<p>I need to create something for my blogging better.</p>
