        <p>I started doing a slight tweak to my workout routine. </p>
<p>I do 1 set per exercise, and push to do 20 reps of that set. If I don&#39;t make it, I rest for 30 seconds and try to squeeze out some more, and repeat until I hit 20 with minimal rest.  </p>
<p>I write down the weight and the number of reps of my first failure. When I can make it to 20 reps without failure, then the next workout I up the weight. It works really well, and I can do a full body workout in under 45 minutes and get great gains thanks to really tapping out each muscle group.  </p>
<p>Doing heaver weights and less reps tends to cause more injuries for me (I am 46) and I always found I had plenty of gas still in the tank when I did drop sets, so I knew I wasn&#39;t really reaching my limit. This makes it so I can reach my limit without having to pull off plates and do lots of sets. It also gives an clear goal - 20 reps every time, even if you have to take mini breaks.</p>
<p>Research has shown that number of reps is not really that important to muscle growth - what is important is pushing to failure, and this seems to really get me to that failure. If I can&#39;t even do another rep at what should be a fraction of my 1 rep max, then I know that I have reached true failure.</p>
