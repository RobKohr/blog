        <p>This is a <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DannyWeinbaum/20191115/353349/Genre_Viability_on_Steam_and_Other_Trends__An_Analysis_Using_Review_Count.php">great article about what games perform well on steam based upon their tags (categories)</a>.</p>
<p>Some games like strategy war games, which I have a great love for, make great money, and there are also very few of them. Other games like puzzlers are plentiful and don&#39;t make much. He also goes into the normal lifespan of a game and its revenue stream which tapers off after 5 years.</p>
<p>There were so many good tidbits in there, and even a multipage spreadsheet of useful sales data, which is like gold now that steamspy can no longer function.</p>
<p>One thing that seems to really make great money is the tag &quot;moddable.&quot; Definitely not easy to do in something like godot (or anything else for that matter) but it seems to make a big impact on profitability.</p>
