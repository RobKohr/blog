        <p>Do the imperfect.</p>
<p>Do that which is tedious in whatever way gets you through it.</p>
<p>Though it may suck, both the doing and how well you do it, it is far better than to not do the thing you are looking to do.</p>
<p>Everyone is always intimidated that the thing they want to do is populated by those who are producing such quality. Remember that everyone starts out at the bottom. (example: <a href="http://robkohr.com/articles/popular-youtubers---look-at-their-old-stuff">http://robkohr.com/articles/popular-youtubers---look-at-their-old-stuff</a>)</p>
<p>But remember anything is better than zero, and being persistently bad is how you get to be good. </p>
<p>To help, log, chart, keep records of how bad you are with whatever you are looking to achieve. What seems demotivating now will help remind you of how those minuscule daily improvements lead to greater things.</p>

        <p>I kinda love going to a popular youtuber&#39;s channel, going to their videos section, and sorting by oldest. </p>
<p>What is now a polished producer of content that makes you feel intimidated to even attempt to make videos was once someone with a crappy camera, shooting in their back yard with a bad audio setup. </p>
<p>Everyone had to learn to walk before they could run. Whatever you do, that you are doing bad and are discouraged, know that failing is just the first step on the long road to greatness (or the medium length road to goodness if you don&#39;t want to overcommit yourself). </p>
<p>It isn&#39;t that you lack an innate gift that others have, it is simply that you haven&#39;t put in the focused effort over time to achieve. Just keep on grinding and leveling up, because remember, everyone sucked at first.</p>

        <p>Consistency is what I have been progressing more to. It helps to have lots of ideas and passion, but to do something big: build strength, learning a music instrument, run for office, build a side project, etc, requires doing something every day towards that goal in an endless way. I am actually doing all of those things right now, while raising kids and working full time.</p>
<p>To achieve it all - each thing needs 20-60 minutes per day to care and feed a goal to reach maturity.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t beat myself up though. I just have a daily checklist in a markdown textfile, and I can see how many I do each day and try to do them all. I frequently fail, but I try to get done what I can.</p>

        <p>I have been working out using a google spreadsheet to track workouts. I aim to do a 20 rep max each week for each exercise that is slightly above the previous week. So far, it has lead to a nice continuous improvement... assuming I don&#39;t ever skip weeks. Each time I skip more than 2 weeks it pushes me back a little bit. More when I skip a month.</p>
<p>Using Wathen&#39;s formula from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum</a> for 1RM, I can calculate my 1RM from my 20RM, and I also use it to calculate my 10 rep max. After experimenting with it, I found it to be a really accurate formula as I tested it going down to 3 reps. </p>
<p>What this means for me is I can keep doing 20 reps as my target, and it will always keep my 1RM and 10RM improving. This is great as being someone in their mid-40s the strain on my body when doing lower rep maxes is not worth it as I frequently end up hurting myself with lower reps. </p>
<p>Based on the equation, an increase of just 1 pound in weight is equal to 1.64 pounds in 1RM. This means that I am increasing my 1 rep max faster by doing 20 reps than I would be if I was aiming on doing 1 rep.</p>
