        <p>My vive has died in all the ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>One lighthouse got so bad that if you faced it, it would totally lose tracking</li>
<li>The audiostrap headset snapped</li>
<li>The display often messed up and showed two images on one eye</li>
<li>One of the controller trackpads would not click anymore</li>
<li>And finally: The screen just goes black after about a minute of use. I tried a different hdmi cable and that didn&#39;t fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was reading a review that the new Vive that uses inside out tracking was performing very poorly regarding tracking, so won&#39;t be buying that as a replacement, and the Valve index is way too pricey.</p>
<p>So, it looks like the Quest is the machine I will be going with. This is nice, as I was never a fan of the cables attached to your head, and with <a href="https://riftcat.com/vridge">Vridge</a> those PC games supposedly can be streamed to the quest. This is great because I have bought a ton of VR games on steam, and have plenty more in my wishlist.</p>
<p>Perhaps getting back into VR development again would be fun too. Maybe git back to making a VR swordfighting game.</p>
