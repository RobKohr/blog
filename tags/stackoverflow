        <p>Often you will get deep in some code and come up against a wall. After working through it, and reading some documentation, if you haven&#39;t figured it out, it is time to go to stackoverflow.</p>
<p>I have been on stackoverflow for a little over 14 years now, and while I don&#39;t answer a lot of questions (there is a lot of competition for that) I have a lot of questions that I have asked and have given me a pretty respectable score, putting me in the top 6% of users (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/101909/robkohr">https://stackoverflow.com/users/101909/robkohr</a>). </p>
<p>The best things to do, is clearly state the problem, provide <em>concise</em> code that shows the problem in a reproducible way, and then state what you would like to achieve. </p>
<p>Sometimes when I work hard at making a clear question on stack overflow, I end up figuring out the answer myself. This is kinda like rubber duck debugging, but instead of a rubber duck, you are talking to the internet.</p>
<p>Then you end up with being the person asking and answering the question and giving yourself double internet points... which is <em>oh so important</em> :)</p>

        <p>Stack Overflow is like a magic wish granting genie, if all your wishes are constrained to be answers to technical problems. Pretty much and far flung technical question I put in there, the right person comes along and provides an answer.</p>
