        <p><strong>Google Extension Idea: Check out elsewhere for amazon.</strong>
I use a chrome extension called &quot;the invisible hand&quot; which shows you what other online stores are charging in comparison to amazon. It would be great if there was an extension called &quot;check out elsewhere&quot; where your whole cart could be dropped onto one or more storefronts on the web for checkout elsewhere. </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Well, amazon just like google has become the default for people to do one activity - shopping. There is a switching cost, and that is time; if I spend a lot more time shopping somewhere else I might figure out that that site is about equivalent to amazon, but it might not, so rather than investing the time, I stick with amazon. This would reduce the switching cost and prevent amazon from forming a solid monopoly on web commerce. </p>
<p>I am unlikely to build this myself, but I have made some chrome extensions in the past, so if you are a hacker who would like to take the lead on developing this, I could make a significant contribution (50% of development) to making this a reality. </p>
<p>If you have the urge, contact me, and we can make it happen, or just totally take the idea, and run with it yourself. That is cool by me :)</p>

        <p>If you or anyone you know is using bitcoin on android, there is a issue with how android was creating random numbers which made transactions generated on android wallets vulnerable where the private keys could be reverse engineered. </p>
<p>I use BitcoinSpinner, and I upgraded BitcoinSpinner, and then installed a new app from the same developer called Mycellium which seems to be a little better. I then sent all of my money to the new wallet in the Mycellium app, so it is now safe from that vulnerability. </p>
<p>This only effects all of the android apps, and they all need new wallets and addresses as the previous private keys are vulnerable.</p>
<p>For a little background on how this could happen:</p>
<p>Every address has a private key which is used to control the funds in that address. Using a little crypto magic, the private key combined with a random number will create a signature for the transaction that can be verified that it comes from the owner of the public address. If you somehow knew that the random number was 123456, you can reverse the process and get the private key. The problem is with the Android random library, it has a tendency to repeatedly generate some &quot;random numbers&quot;. Ironically the library is called SecureRandom. I think it was on the shelf next to UnsinkableShip.</p>

        <p>For some reason I have been thinking a lot about health bars, HP in RPGs, and RTS&#39;</p>
<p>The idea of diminishing health until a character is dead just seems to be very far from reality. If you get hit by a sword or arrow or bullet, you are either critically wounded (crippled), dead, or maybe it was just a flesh wound, but it isn&#39;t like a number of successful hits lead to your death or incapacitation.</p>
<p>As I watch two soldiers riddle each other full of bullets while running around, I just think that something is really way off with this whole idea of health power.</p>
<p>It would be great when two armies clashed in an RTS game, some amount of chance, proper support and positioning, and clever strategy lead to immediate falling soldiers and incapacitated equipment. When you are playing that RPG game, you either get a critical hit on that monster, or you just happen to really piss it off (and likewise in return). When you combine weapons, skill and violence, the balance between life and death is balanced on a knife&#39;s edge and it would be great if games reflected that rather than having two orcs hit each other&#39;s heads for a full minute while someone casts healing spells on them and dragons are dropping fireballs from above. </p>
<p>It is time to train more necromancers than healers.</p>

and thinking about how google is slowly bringing about a dystopian future. Their maps app and android phone can allow you to be tracked wherever you go. Your email can easily be read by authorities, and plus to link all of your associations together. Google docs gives them a window into your business, finances, papers, and whatever you might create a spreadsheet for.  Google search can clue them in to what you are curious and thinking about. Google glass, if adopted by 0.1% of the population would provide a perfect monitoring system for crowds of people. Their automatic car driving thing they are working on for cars could one day take away your control of getting around. </p>
<p>All of these things are amazing steps forward for communication and empowerment, but they also put huge amounts of trust in a single entity which will have no choice but to bow to government pressures. </p>
<p>Client side cryptography where all data stored in the cloud is encrypted is the only way to prevent government snooping. It would be great to see a company focused on following google&#39;s lead on easy communication tools, but with a layer built in for customer protection that cannot be undermined by the company itself.</p>

<p>Whatever side you are identified yourself with, you are identifying yourself with a side that supports an evil financial system, an imperialist military system, and a corrupt bought out political system controlled by career politicians who&#39;s main focus is getting enough campaign contributions to continually be reelected - often at the expense of your rights.</p>
<p>Stop applying a label to yourself and think freely. </p>
<p>The issues that both sides wheel out both have merit, and should be deeply considered regarding how we want our society to function. Look at the constitution and the bill of rights. The people who created these documents thought about issues that are still relevant today, and the dogma of the political parties are slowly washing away the soul of this nation.</p>

Basically both parties hate it as it greatly reduces government programs and raises taxes.</p>
<p>I am not too down on the raising taxes, it is great to see a real reduction in government actually happen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is all a lot of theater. The law enacted in 1986 that forces congress to adhere to a prescribed budget (otherwise face across the board automatic cuts) has never taken effect since every year they just modify the law and adjust up the budget limit.</p>
<p>I guess this is always the problem when you try to write a law to control the people that can simply rewrite the law. Maybe there needs to be some designation of &quot;super-law&quot; which cannot be rewritten. This would basically be an amendment to the constitution, and I would love to see something wedged into there to prevent lawmakers from spending more money, though I loath to see them monkey with that document.</p>

        <p>I think conspiracy theories are sometimes conspiracy in themselves. </p>
<p>ZeroHedge put the RT as a bullet point, and feel that it requires a little comment. </p>
<p>I think that the RT is nothing more than a russian news puppet show that is similar to our leaflet bombings of enemies in prior wars. Their purpose is to destabilize the US. Just like our leaflet campaigns, it is very convenient when those in power are doing horrible things, because you just need to spread the truth that suits your mission.</p>
<p>The RT is a fantastic source of info, but keep in mind who is pulling the strings. I am still awaiting their scathing commentary on Putin or the situation in Chechnya. </p>
<p>All news sources &amp; blogs have an agenda, or are backed by someone with an agenda. Identify that agenda, and allow the recognition of that agenda be a filter for every word they say. News is great for information, but only in the same way that the words of a poker player should be carefully considered when they are talking about their own hand.</p>

        <p><strong>A new way to round - rand_round</strong>
So in grade school you are taught the basics of rounding. If the decimal portion of the number is &lt; .5 round down to the integer so 5.3 becomes 5. If it is &gt;= .5 round up, so 5.8 becomes 6.
 
This is well and good if you are doing something that has an even distribution after the decimal point. But lets say that you are doing continuous small adjustments on a value and it is unlikely to be an evenly distributed set since the calculation for the adjustment will typically be the same.
 
An example senerio that got me thinking about this is related to a game I am working on at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://constantsail.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">constantsail.com</a>. Every minute 1 food is consumed for each crew member on a ship, but I want to do a smaller time slice of every 6 seconds which is 1/10 of a food per crew for that interval. Food is an integer in the db, so it must be rounded off in one way or another. If we just used the round function in mysql, and we had two crew members, I would be subtracting round(.2) ever time which comes out to zero. What I really want is it to return zero 80% of the time, and one 20% of the time, so in the long run, it still ends up being 2 food consumed for the two crew for every minute.
 
To do this I take the result of rand() which returns a value from 0 to 1 and if it is less than D (which is the decmial portion of the value we are rounding) we add 1 to the floored value of our original number, else we just floor the value.
 
The equation is:</p>
<pre><code>
function rand_round(x){
 D = x - floor(x);
 if(rand() &amp;lt; D){
   return floor(x)+1;
 }else{
   return floor(x);
 }
}
               
</code></pre>

        <p><em>Ebay&#39;s failure as an auction site</em></p>
<p>Too often when I go to ebay now, I just find merchants filling the search results with either &quot;buy it now&quot; items, or auctions with too high of a starting price.</p>
<p>I wish they would do something about this. A simple solution would be a 5% charge of the listing price when you put something up for sale. People would then be more likely to put things up for zero, and a normal auction would happen. </p>
<p>Unfortunately ebay is drifting from an auction site to just a low scale merchant site.</p>

        <p><strong>Book review of Starship Troopers I posted on Amazon.com</strong></p>
<p>This is totally different than the movie, but only in good ways. Heinlein is a expert of political philosophy applied to science fiction and paints a world of a fascist government that is embraced by its citizens, and you can sympathise with those citizens and see how they view it in a positive light. I love a book where you can see things from outside of your own perspective and still relate to the characters. It also allows you to see the current direction our world is taking and how external military threats can shape a nation, and how the shape of the nation can help generate those external threats.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, space marines go kill aliens. That is fun too. </p>
<p>If you end up liking this, go pick up The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. In that, it shows how a revolution based on libertarian virtues breaks out on the moon and overthrows a repressive government. They aren&#39;t at all in the same story line, but in some ways I feel it makes a good follow up.</p>

<p>I constantly tell myself that every time I wonder why things aren&#39;t getting done at the speed that I expect for personal projects. Typically it comes down to being overzealous with my project timelines, or just doing too many things that are distracting me from my goals (like reading hacker news).</p>

    <article>
        <p><strong>When we reach 21 Million Bitcoins, will their be no economic activity, and a deflation spiral?</strong>
 #bitcoin<br>I think an assumption here is </p>
<p>Fixed monetary quantity = deflation.</p>
<p>The increase or decrease in money value is not entirely based upon scarcity. </p>
<p>A major factor in inflation is monetary velocity (how much the money flows around). If all holders of bitcoin suddenly started using bitcoins for the majority of their transactions, we would face rapid inflation. </p>
<p>Also, whatever equation you use to quantify the value of money goes out the window once it hits perception. How people view a currency is more important to its value than anything else. </p>
<p>Yes, people might hold bitcoins for some time as the price goes up, but if it doesn&#39;t go up forever, and starts to flatline, people will want to start getting rid of it, and this will cause a feedback loop that might make it so people will jump ship as fast as they can.</p>
<p>In the end, without some large economic event, I think bitcoins are fairly stable, and will just get more stable over time. That means they will become a pretty piss poor investment, especially if they end up only deflating at &lt;5% annually. Investing in revenue generating businesses would end up being more lucrative. Also, investing in things that would provide immediate happiness would be more valuable. </p>
<p>Only about 7200 per day are being produced right now, and I am sure speculators are already adjusting their valuations for output halving (it is not like it is a surprise). So we are looking at moving from $36000 per day to $18000 per day in &quot;quantitate easing.&quot; With the number of people in bitcoin, I consider that to mean that for all purposes, we have practically reached the end of money production.</p>
<p>So here you are. The train has basically reached the $21M quantity. Look around you, because at this point, I think speculators are going to get bored soon, and move on to some other new beanie baby. We have some stuff you can buy and sell, and it makes a great currency for gambling and buying drugs. I see a super bright future in its use in games, and if the USD ever falls apart, bitcoin and precious metal holders will be laughing all the way to the bank (not to say they will be rich, but just that they have weathered a storm). Bitcoins will go up and down in value, but really I think it is pretty much in the right ballpark now. The economy will grow one storefront at a time, and hopefully it will be a boring useful part of the economy, and not a long dead fad.</p>

        <p>I am surprised it took people this long to strap a gun to a quadrocopter. Unfortunately, FPS is right. This is the future. Though I can see a person controlling a semi-autonomous squad of them rather than just a single one.</p>
<p>One would be the eyes of the operator, and with a mouse he could click multiple targets and the copters would swarm attack independently. He could then click on a map to have them move to the next zones of combat, and of course fly back to the recharge vehicle automatically when needed. </p>
<p>As with anything, there will be countermeasures. I am sure radio interference would be one of the first ones, hence the need for semi-autonomous operation. But I am sure, a signal will always get through. Targeting and destroying these little buggers will be a pain too, and it looks like they could be mass produced cheaply (and exploded rather than return for a recharge). In the end, you probably need to either cut off communications with the operator or eliminate the operator (if possible since this could be all the way across the world).</p>
<p>This technology is an obvious evolution of warfare, but I think more interesting will be the countermeasures.</p>

        <p>They put all over this that this is conceptual design, and not actual gameplay. But I hope they make it look even a little like this as it is pretty hot.</p>
<p>This will require a constant internet connection as they are implementing stuff that will have economic balancing with other cities in your &quot;region.&quot; Cool. </p>
<p>I always thought that simcity should have an online mode, but not with loosely connected regions. It would be great to just have one continuous terrain that people build on. You would need to have bidding wars with neighboring cities to acquire more development zones, and perhaps incircle areas to make them more unattractive to your neighbors. Have lower taxes and suck away their citizens, and form trade agreements that help both sides. Water wars, transportation networks, federalization of areas, drug legal cities that cause spillover effects in other cities, plagues...</p>
<p>There are so many possibilities that I have seen them skip in previous simcities that I really hope they pursue in this one.  With an internet enabled game, you can stretch the possibilities and break out of the bubble that previous simcity games have been in.</p>
<p>Or they can just improve the graphics, make it less grid like, add some improvements, and make this just another iteration of a really over done idea. It will still sell like hotcakes anyway, and will be less risky than a more competitive socially oriented simcity.</p>
<p> Here is theOfficial GDC 2012 announce trailer for SimCity by EA Maxis. SimCity is a PC/MAC online city building simulation game from Maxis Studios. It is the quiessential city builder franchise that started a genre. SimCity is back and bigger than ever with a new 3D world to create and control and multi-player to play with your friends for the first time.

        <p>On FB and G+ games, they don&#39;t allow you to modify the permissions for the games. What if I don&#39;t want to give you my email address and all of my info?</p>
<p>Checkboxes would be nice, and the game creator will then have the chose of refusing me if I don&#39;t give enough info.</p>
<p>For game creators, don&#39;t ask for permissions that aren&#39;t needed (don&#39;t ask for any). If I like your game, I will tell my friends. If I want to have you email me, I will subscribe to your email list. Don&#39;t make all this bs the cost of admission. I just won&#39;t pay.</p>

        <p><strong>Follow everyone that someone else is following on twitter</strong></p>
<p>I opened up a second twitter account, and I wanted to follow everyone my first twitter account was following. I went to the &quot;following&quot; page for the first account and started clicking away, till bordom ensued. Then I did an inspect element on the follow button, and with a little jquery magic, did a quick follow of everyone. I just opened up the javascript console, and entered.
$(&#39;.js-action-follow&#39;).click();</p>
<p>Done!</p>

<p>I created a site where you can post links, videos, images, and blobs of text (html allowed).</p>
<p>It works much like most social news sites where visitors can vote up stories they like to the home page in various different categories. The difference is that the voting is in bitcoins in increments of 0.001 units. 80% of the bitcoins received go to the poster of the article.</p>
<p>Posting and voting up articles is an anonymous process, and no login is needed (also IP addresses &amp; sessions are not recorded). For those that are into Tor, onion links are welcome and are marked with an onion icon. Hopefully this will help with the discovery of content on the onion network.

    <article>
        <p>It looks like SOPA and PIPA have likely been stopped as politicians have dropped support for it.</p>
<p>It was a great move for freedom, but on a more sour grapes note: where was this outpouring of popular dissent when so many non-internet freedoms have been taken away. </p>
<p>It looks as though without yesterday&#39;s actions these bills had a good chance of passing. This was really a story of the internet giants stepping up to government to oppose something that would have destroyed their freedoms. They attacked the government by raising awareness of the issue to the general public which had a mutual interest in protecting these freedoms. </p>
<p>And the people marched (called) on their representatives to voice their disapproval. </p>
<p>The problem is that many freedoms aren&#39;t relied on by corporations in a position to raise awareness. When a bill was signed by Obama that gave the right to lock up individuals without due process, google didn&#39;t change their logo to show someone trapped in a cage. </p>
<p>I am not suggesting that they should have taken a stand on that issue, as they are a corporation, and a corporation&#39;s mission is not to be a political activist (unless it has an need to be). What I am suggesting is that people need to be informed about what is going on in government. Many people thing that politics aren&#39;t interesting and don&#39;t involve them. Yet politics shape the direct reality of their day to day life. </p>
<p>Laws are written about what you can say, do, and who you can associate with. Proposals are made to raise taxes, cut or add services, inflate away the value of your money, and adjust how much the government can monitor and track all forms of speech.</p>
<p>The internet corporations have successfully fought for their freedoms because they are informed. Individuals need to do the same.</p>

        <p>Picture wars is a forum based game where a 2-d sidescroll style map is used. 2 or more players each use their own sprite pack armies in a turned based war game. </p>
<p>Each turn, players move their units and attack things by updating the image. Whatever makes sense is considered acceptable. Along with the update of the image, text is also included in the forum post explaining what happened in the turn.</p>

This is the original video compiling recent images and video to give his speech a chilling effect. &quot;I have no timetable for these predictions, but just in case, keep them around and look at them in 5-10 years. Let&#39;s hope and pray that I&#39;m wrong on all accounts. If so, I will be very pleased. &quot;</p>

<p>Now I am even more hesitant to use it. Google search has been a winner due to its clean layout and generally not being biased. </p>
<p>It looks like that era is over.</p>

This is such an important point: there is no difference between &quot;too big to fail&quot; and &quot;an offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot;. It&#39;s protection racketeering in a five thousand dollar suit.
&quot;Nice economy you have here. It would be a shame if anything happened to it.</p>

        <p><strong>Fake Amazon Reviews</strong></p>
<p>Important when looking at reviews on Amazon: click on their profiles and see what else a person reviewed.</p>
<p>I find a lot of reviewers are fake, and are really just sock puppets of the person selling the item.</p>
<p>When the person reviewing the item only ever reviewed this item, or reviewed only items from this seller, it is likely a fake.</p>
<p>Here is an example:

<p>The Act legislatively codifies the President&#39;s authority to indefinitely detain terrorism <em>suspects</em> without trial. This can include US citizens on American soil.</p>
<p>(at this point I had about a dozen sarcastic remarks about Obama, but really I think none are needed.)</p>

        <p>Being a father of a 4 year old, I have watched someone learn their first language. He really understands english very well, but he has shown me the many inconstancies and exceptions in our language. It would be great to use a survey of common &quot;mistakes&quot; a child makes in understanding the english language as a basis for how the language should be reshaped to make it more consistent.</p>

        <p>A better way to fight SOPA</p>
<p>GoDaddy has been a supporter of SOPA which has caused many to boycott them.</p>
<p>Here is an even better way to hit them in the bottom line...</p>
<p>Add this somewhere in your webpage (you can just stick it somewhere in the footer)
&lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.namecheap.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.namecheap.com</a>&quot;&gt;Domain Registration</a></p>
<p>GoDaddy is #1 in google for &quot;Domain Registration&quot;, but if enough people link to this (it doesn&#39;t take much) they will be nocked out of the coveted top spot. This will be a huge dent in their revenue stream, as I think their target audience are people that just chose the first google result. </p>
<p>This is referred to as a &quot;google bomb&quot; and it works by the fact that search ranking is based upon the the weight of the links pointed to a page. The name of the link helps them correlate the search terms that match with the link. </p>
<p>Namecheap was chosen as they have a high ranking (so they have a good chance at popping to the top) and has been vocal in being anti-SOPA. You can use the coupon code &quot;SOPASucks&quot; to get a discount there too. </p>
<p>I just added it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://editthis.info" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">editthis.info</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cueflash.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">cueflash.com</a> (both with a page rank of 5). That will hit them in the SEOs.</p>
<p>--
edit: I added this to explain why I was linking:</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.namecheap.com" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.namecheap.com</a>&quot;&gt;Domain Registration</a>

        <p>Google has been manipulating their algorithm, with the goal of making it more friendly to users.</p>
<p>This means it will find results that do not match all of your criteria, but are more &quot;meaningful&quot; ~= higher page rank.</p>
<p>They have also ditched the + operator (+keyword) which forces only results that contain matches for that keyword. They have added a verbatim option hidden in the left rail (you have to fold out to reveal it) which should make it so all terms must match. Also wrapping a term in quotes should also force things. </p>
<p>In the end results get more fuzzy, and when you know exactly what you want, it just pisses you off.</p>
<p>For example, I am trying to find javascript code for calculating TrueSkill (it is an algorithm that XBox uses that is used for their ranking). </p>
<p>So I type in
 +&quot;TrueSkill&quot; +&quot;Javascript&quot;
and do a verbatim search, just to be through (because every other variation still didn&#39;t get me what I want.</p>
<p>What do I get, some results with Javascript in it, some with TrueSkill in it, and a one with both. </p>

        <p>It is really annoying when source code download sites don&#39;t provide a url that you can use with curl (usually it is some html redirect page that does tracking for them). </p>
<p>I want to download the code onto the server. I don&#39;t want to download it locally and then scp it to the server. </p>
<p>What I love is the url usually has .zip at the end of it, so I happily curl it and unzip it, and unzip yells at me because I am trying to unzip an html file.</p>

        <p>After futzing with Adobe Illustrator for a while, and getting fed up, I hand coded an SVG file and imported it in. So much easier when you want to be accurate. Trying to tell the software what you want with pointing and clicking just isn&#39;t as good as typing in <polygon points="...." style="..."></p>
<p>I guess this would be different if I was doing a complicated graphic, but when just doing circles, squares, text, etc it just makes sense to type out what you want.</p>

<p>This is an easy way to give someone bitcoins, even if they don&#39;t have a bitcoin wallet. </p>
<p>Simply scan the public address on the cheque, transfer bitcoins to it, and write in the amount the cheque was funded with. </p>
<p>This is perfect for paying a merchant, or perhaps selling bitcoins to someone as an investment.</p>

A user posted up content that was copyrighted, and dreamhost recieved a DMCA takedown notice. They shut my site down, without first giving me any notice (though, in their defense, it was easy to turn it back on).</p>
<p>I also run a UGC site on linode (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://editthis.info" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">editthis.info</a>), and had the same situtation there (except the person who made the complaint was wrong and I protected the users&#39; contributions). Linode actually allowed me to address the issue rather than just pulling the plug.</p>
<p>If you are going to run a site where a user might post something that violates copyright (a forum, a blog with comments, or practically anything), and you would prefer not to have a provider that shoots first, and asks questions later, go with Linode.

    <article>
        <p>So someone sent a DMCA notice to my service provider. They were complaining about content that they considered their copyright in a wiki I am hosting. It was a page about their news station WHKY TV. Looking through the history of the page, I could see that a bunch of people worked together to create the page. </p>
<p>After a bunch of back and forth messages where he took a week to reply each time (and capped off each one with a legal threat), my final message to them ended with:</p>
<p>&quot;Also, reply within 24 hours. I don&#39;t care how busy you are. You are
the one who is wasting my time with what I suspect is a fishing
expedition then threatening legal action. All the while I am complying
with the investigation clause in your request.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Rob&quot;
I hate DMCA lawyers. It would be great if there was some recourse for BS claims.</p>

        <p>What happens when you round 3.6 ---&gt; you get 4. </p>
<p>What about in a game? Should every time a player kills 3.6 of an enemy, should it be really 4? </p>
<p>Probably not, but the math might have that happen all of the time. It should be that it rounds up 60% of the time. Over time, the average player would then kill 3.6 enemies, without having to deal without the sticky philosophical questions of an enemy that is 40% alive.</p>
<p>Here is a little function that will prevent that. (in JS, but easy to convert)</p>
<pre><code> //adjusts a value up or down to nearest int with a random factor 
 //based upon the decimal value. i.e. 3.2 has a 80% chance of being 3, 20% of 4 var randRound = function(num){

        <p>Working hard on Constant Sail: Pirates &amp; Traders for the October competition. It is a pirate game where you sail around a world and trade goods. It is multiplayer and web based with a big emphasis on PvP fighting.</p>
<p>As you can see, even though I am making this for the web, it is being formatted to also work well on smartphones.</p>

        <p>This is what 3d should really be.</p>
<p> Using the infrared camera in the Wii remote and a head mounted sensor bar (two IR LEDs), you can accurately track the location of your head and render view dependent images on the screen. This effectively transforms your display into a portal to a virtual environment. The display properly reacts to head and body movement as if it were a real window creating a realistic illusion of depth and space. By Johnny Chung Lee, Carnegie Mellon University.

What you see is what you hear (no lip-syncing for instruments or voice). 2. If you hear it, at some point you see it (no hidden sounds). Lyrics: If you think i&#39;ll give you money, well honey that&#39;s just funny cuz i got none. No money, ain&#39;t got no money. If you just want conversation go somewhere in the nation, not my house. But if you think you need some lovin, that&#39;s fine. Cuz if you think you need some money, well you can&#39;t have mine, and if you want some conversation try a pickup line. But if you think you need some lovin, that&#39;s fine. If you think you need a shrink, you&#39;re draining down the sink, go take a hike. Ain&#39;t got no time for your baggage. If you think you need a fix, don&#39;t put me in the mix, just stick to wine. Whine, wine, whine, wine, whine, wine. But if you think you need some lovin, that&#39;s fine. Cuz if you think you need a shrink, well I&#39;m out of time. And if you think you need a fix, I&#39;m not the fixing kind. But if you think you need some lovin, that&#39;s fine.</p>

?
I had plans on building something like Survey Monkey with it, but I don&#39;t think it would be worth my time. </p>
<p>I think it is a pretty awesome name, but not worth it to me to do the $10 renewal. If you want it, let me know (though keep in mind it will still cost $10 to get it).  I can transfer it to you after renewing.</p>
<p>Otherwise the squatters can take it :)</p>

        <p>If you have a search results page on your website, try to minimize the amount that users have to use the pager on those results.</p>
<p>Google gets away with showing only 10 results, because they are awesome at delivering what you are looking for in that first page. Your results probably aren&#39;t that successful. </p>
<p>Here is a simple measure: If more than 5% of the visitors to your results page click the next button, double the number of results you show on the page. Keep doing that until the number gets below 5%.</p>

        <p>1994 - Pulp fiction &amp; Inflation</p>
<p>There was a scene that really focused on the cost of a $5 milkshake. This was between two characters that probably blow plenty of money on coke and heroin.</p>
<p>Today, a $5 milkshake is no big deal. Heck, that is how much a coffee is (the cheapest beverage to make on earth) at *$. I wonder how expensive it would have to be today to amaze these John Travolta&#39;s character today.</p>
<p> pretty fucking good milkshake</p>

        <p>Been researching the Cetera audial algorithm after hearing about (and experiencing) the Virtual Barber Shop for the first time. 
The technology in itself is incredible, and it surely opens an entire world of alternative entertainment and media. It&#39;s a surprise no one&#39;s really capitalised on it yet specifically for that purpose, but its use in hearing aids is probably the best use I can imagine. </p>
<p>If you want to know what I&#39;m talking about, go here:

<p>The narrator-guy explains it in a small way, and it&#39;s just insane. </p>
<p><strong>Important: headphones are a must!</strong></p>
<p> You&#39;ll need headphones for this to work. Make sure there is no noise around, close your eyes, turn the volume up a little bit, hold and press headphone on your ears for better hearing, play it and enjoy this impressive audio work ( illusion ).

        <p>_scoreTag allows you to tag your posts the same way you could using twitter #hashTags</p>
<p>It is has a _chromeExtension which turns a _scoreTag into a link. This allows users to quickly find other posts regarding a particular topic. </p>
<p>Why not just use #hashTag? Well, google ignores the # symbol when it indexes pages for searching, so it doesn&#39;t do much good if you actually want to find posts using it.</p>

Has been a great fill in for all those times I just wished I had access to the 1M+ functions php seems to have.</p>
<p>I like to wrap it all in an object so I can access something like:
php.explode(&#39;,&#39;, someString);</p>
<h2>and so it makes sense when the functions in javascript break the convention of camelCase names for php_functions. </h2>

        <p>This is a pretty unique game. </p>
<p>In it you create a fleet and send it into battle, but the catch is that you don&#39;t control anything once play begins. </p>
<p>Most of the actual interaction you have with the game is tweaking the ships, and you can do it in extreme detail. This is basically where you grit your teeth over. </p>
<p>It has single player, plus multiplayer, but you don&#39;t have to be online to have your fleets fight it out.</p>

&quot;Maybe to remove the whole illusion, we should just literally vote with dollars. Those dollars can than be used by the govt in place of taxes. Could lead to an interesting distopia or utopia. Who knows?&quot;</p>

        <p>So my 3 year old is totally into video games (in particular a game on the wii called Excite Truck).</p>
<p>This game and a bunch of games on the iphone that he likes has led me to one conclusion.</p>
<p>Menus suck (especially if you can&#39;t read). </p>
<p>What would be best is a big Go button that is green and flashing. You press it, and whatever level, weapon, ship, car, gravity level, or whatever is just randomized. Finish your mission or die and you get another go button. </p>
<p>Below the go button can be Campaign mode, Custom, Settings, etc. I like tweaking out things and fiddling too, but always give the option of Go.</p>

    <article>
        <p>I am working on a programming game where you control an army of robots via a web api. </p>
<p>You can send orders to robots, or you can install javascript code in robots, and when they are out of communications range from your command center, they can use that code to work autonomously. </p>
<p>The robots will be the typical variety of units that you would expect in an rts game (submarines, tanks, infantry, etc). They will run on fuel which will need to be transported to the front line by workers (which will have their own scripts to handle logistics). </p>
<p>Communications will be key and setting up relay towers to send new messages and code to distant soldiers will be important (otherwise they will be in the dark, and you won&#39;t know what they are up to). Sending and receiving messages will cost fuel. </p>
<p>The game will have no graphical user interface. A companion project is also set up which will allow people to create the interface and modify it to their liking using html5/javascript/etc etc.</p>
<p>The initial api stuff can be seen here:

<p>If you are interested in getting involved in the development of this game, let me know. (This is not a job, there will likely be no profit here)</p>
<p>Technology involved: Node.js + express + mongodb</p>
<p>If you just want to do the client end stuff, you will need to know jQuery and be able to work with JSON.</p>

        <p>Going to see The Protomen tomorrow night. Totally psyched.</p>
<p> The first music video of The Protomen. For more info. visit <a href="http://www.protomen.com/">http://www.protomen.com/</a> [Lyrics] Narrator: No one was left who could remember how it had happened, how the world had fallen under darkness. At least no one who would do anything. No one who would oppose the robots. No one who would challenge their power, or so Dr. Wily believed... Twenty Floors above the dark streets of the city, Dr. Light lived in a run-down tenement. An eccentric and brilliant man. Light was a loner, a thinker, a man of ideas. Ideas forbidden in Wily&#39;s society. The society for which he worked. The society in which he lived. The society that he would set free. And so Light worked, far into the night, when the watchful eyes of Wily&#39;s robots weren&#39;t upon him. He&#39;d set his skillful hands to the task of creating a device to bring about a change, to create a machine to bring freedom, to create a man to save the world. Twelve years Light worked and on a cold night in the year 200X, Protoman was born. A perfet man, an unbeatable machine, hell-bent on destroying every evil standing between man and freedom, built for one purpose, to destroy Wily&#39;s army of evil robots. Ready, willing, prepared to fight Cutman Gutsman Elecman Bombman Fireman Iceman Proto Fireman: Attack! Narrator: Fight. And as the smoke cleared. Wiley rose above the countless robots remaining. Protoman was wounded, low on energy, struggling to remain standing as Wily ordered the final attack. The death of Protoman. The crowd had gathered there to watch him fall, to watch their hopes destroyed. They watched them beat him, they watched them break him, they watched his last defense deployed. There was not a man among them who would let himself be heard. But from the crowd, from the collective fear, arose these broken words: We are the dead We are the dead Human Choir: What have we done? Narrator: We are the dead Human CHoir: What will we do? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: Where will we turn? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: Is there nothing we can do? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: How did it come to this? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: How did we go so wrong? Narrator: We are the dead Human Choir: We are the dead</p>

        <p>Have you ever played the board game Diplomacy before? I am looking to start a postal game (where you mail stamped letters to each-other) where the adjudication is done via the web (there is no game master). I set up a game that starts in 6 days at the link. Join up, and send me an email with your postal mailing address when the game starts, along with your nation. I will send the mailing addresses to everyone in the game. My email address with google is robkohr.</p>

        <p>Speedcrunch is a great calculator application that is available on all major OSes</p>
<p>It works very much like a scientific calculator, with variables and complex expressions. It also gives you updates to the calculation as you are typing.
Though it is seems complex, it is my favorite to use even for the most basic of calculations. It is fast and the interface is simple to use.
Oh, and it is free:

        <p>Due to really poor sales in the app store (kinda expected since it was just an astroids clone) space rocks is now free. When I get around to it, I will post up the source code on github. It was written with JS using the canvas element for drawing. It was bundled into an iOS app using phonegap.</p>
<p>If you have an urge to hack on it, just post a comment here, and I will post up the source earlier (right now it is a low priority).</p>

        <p> Michael Fishbach, co-founder of The Great Whale Conservancy (GWC), narrates his encounter with a young humpback whale entangled in local fishing nets. At first, the animal appeared to be dead, yet Fishbach investigated and quickly discovered that the poor creature was tangled in a fishing net. The humans had to act fast; what began as a tragedy soon became a thrilling rescue as Fishbach and his crew labored to free the young whale. The entire encounter was caught on videotape and later narrated by Fishbach himself. This young whale knows how to show appreciation by treating them to a magnificent aerial spectacle after it was finally freed.

I like apes and monkeys, I like classic movies like this one, I like dance music, I like Benny Benassi, and I used to like glowsticks when I was 19... so I made this video. If the usage of this footage or music for this artistic expression causes any issues with you, please contact me directly (info found easily at <a href="http://www.bradhasse.com">www.bradhasse.com</a>) and I&#39;ll take it down. But ever since this idea popped into my head, I couldn&#39;t help but try to make it for the fun of it to see what it would look like if Charlton Heston found a few glowsticks, turntables, and an insatiable urge to dance. Since I work with some amazing graphics people, we decided to just give it a go. This is a result of that collaboration. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The footage is from the original 1968 &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; The music is a medley of songs from Benny Benassi Presents The Biz- &quot;Hypnotica&quot; album (Get Loose, Satisfaction, Time, I Wanna Touch Your Soul) Directed, Edited, Concept by Brad Hasse <a href="http://www.bradhasse.com">www.bradhasse.com</a> Visual Effects and Design by EP</em>Vision -Maryam Parwana -Brian Walsh <a href="http://www.epvision.tv">www.epvision.tv</a> East Pleasant Pictures <a href="http://www.eastpleasant.com">www.eastpleasant.com</a></p>

<p> The late great Peggy Lee, a favorite of mine (I&#39;m a huge Jazz fan). Peggy was a singer in The Benny Goodman Orchestra before going solo. You may also know her as the voice of the Siamese Cats in Disneys &#39;Lady and The Tramp.&#39;</p>
