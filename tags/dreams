        <p>I wrote this a long while back about a dream I had about a race that happens every year. This isn&#39;t a normal race, but one where participants can bring all manner of things to race with (skateboards, bikes, etc) but most chose to go by foot.  </p>
<p>The race starts in the dark of night, in a dense cityscape. The route is chosen that involves back allays, bridges, tunnels, fences, walls, and all sorts of difficult structures to cross. Some paths are down right dangerous. All of these paths are the shortest paths, where participants can take the longer slower path, avoiding danger and possible trespassing charges.  </p>
<p>It all started out small at first, just a group of friends just doing it for fun. But before the designated start time this year, hundreds of people crowded through the tight starting point. There was no starting gun, there was no referee. You could hear the sound of a multitude of cell phones ringing their own little alarm sound.  </p>
<p>People clamored over each other. People that brought bikes found that they were too cumbersome to carry over obstacles and manage in the throng of people. There were many with bruises and scratches, but no one seemed to get any broken bones this year.  </p>
<p>The race terminated in the industrial section of town. An area where no one was likely to call the cops for the noise, but soon enough they would show up anyway. I say terminated, because there wasn&#39;t much of a finish line. Just a band warming up. A hardcore chick beating on the drums could be heard blocks away. That was the siren call to those who lost their way.  </p>
<p>One or two arrived at a time, then building up to the mass that have been squeezing through the small arteries of the city, trying to get to its beating heart. They arrived grimy, beaten, and yet beaming with pride. No one noticed who actually won or lost the race, the race was with themselves. They all hovered around as more and more flowed in, and the band powered through their set. The amps were hooked up to someone&#39;s car for juice. As the guitar played its cords, the headlights dimmed with the rhythm of the music.</p>

        <p>The Jumpers</p>
<p>The year was 2016, and researchers at the CTEX2 particle accelerator lab discovered a way to slow time around a local area to near zero. Anyone within this field would feel that they jumped forward in time in a flash. </p>
<p>Before long, the jumpBooth became a commercial product, retailing for a mere million dollars. NASA bought them with the idea of once again going to space and traveling longer distances without life support. People with terminal diseases bought them to perhaps jump to when they could be cured. Some people even got some money together to send a historian on a journey to tell the future what it was really like to live today. </p>
<p>The ones that bought them the most though, were investors. There was someone named Warren Buffet that just popped up ever 10 years, looked around made some quick transactions and moved on. Others joined the flow into the future looking for great gains over long term investment plans. This had the effect of slowing the growth of stocks and decreasing long term returns.</p>
<p>As the price fell for the jumpBooth, more people could use it. During wars the peace-nicks would jump forward looking for a more peaceful world. Without any movement to rally against the wars, the wars stretched on. </p>
<p>During a technological dark age where there were few advancements, the inventors and innovators began jumping and created a brain drain into the future. </p>
<p>Eventually everyone could jump, and did so frequently. The weather wasn&#39;t good, jump. A plague was breaking out, jump. Not enough people around due to all the jumping, jump.</p>
<p>The weeds began pushing up through the highways, and the wilderness reclaimed the cities. The environment changed to become more inhospitable to a species once known as man, who never had a chance to evolve to match it. Occasionally they would flash in for a moment here and there, but they just kept pushing forward, hoping for a better time and place for themselves that only they could create. </p>
