<p>The actual samples of things the press actually show from the rejection list are things like math textbooks using &quot;What me, racist?&quot; and then having the student use racial bias data that is questionable to solve a problem. This is subtly pushing the racial focused narrative, and they are finding it in a huge number of textbooks, which clearly is a way of pushing a message into kids with a million little cuts.</p>
<p>The message may be right or wrong depending on your opinion, but even if right, it is wrong to try to indoctrinate a belief by sprinkling it throughout all coursework. That is propaganda and with the subtleness that they are doing it, brainwashing.</p>
<p>Also, note that the American Federation of Teachers president that shared a list of banned books retracted it, because the books were not actually banned and the information was fake.</p>
<p>This is much more nuanced, and there is a real problem that is being addressed. If conservatives were controlling education and trying to insert their message everywhere in subtle ways to little kids, wouldn&#39;t you feel pretty pissed off? It is tempting to indoctrinate the mass of future adults with your beliefs through little levers as they are a captive audience in the education system, but that is not a situation that should be abused for even righteous goals. Let them form their own opinions and just teach them the subject they are being taught.</p>

        <p>Just some thoughts I had after watching this video:</p>
<p>Simulation of a Nuclear Blast in a Major City</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo&ab_channel=NeilHalloran">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo&amp;ab_channel=NeilHalloran</a></p>
<p>Nuclear weapons are the reason we haven&#39;t had multiple world wars since WWII. The game mechanics of warfare changed when any major conflict could lead to complete annihilation on both sides.</p>
<p>All wars since then have only be proxy wars through countries that are not nuclear armed. It makes it clear why countries such as NK and Iran would like to have these weapons. It makes them essentially un-invadable.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the movie bedazzled. I could imagine someone war-weary after WWII making a deal with the devil to make it so no major war won&#39;t happen again in their lifetime, and the wish was granted with nukes.</p>
<p>I wonder how many lives were saved by making the cold war not a hot war thanks to nukes, and if long run the debt of saving all those lives will have to be paid in full plus interest.</p>

        <p>Watch the debates between the 3rd party candidates. This is likely to have a lot more &quot;meat&quot; than the watered down thing that is called a debate between the two major parties.</p>

        <p>This was a response to a message posted from an occupy wall street support who felt the occupy movement has nothing to do with libertarians. They also were speaking about the need to regulate business:</p>
<p>Most libertarians are against the bail out of wall street, which I suppose the occupy wall street movement is about. </p>
<p>The govt regulations on industry are usually written by industry leaders (not the common man) to solidify their monopolies by making it more difficult for new competition in the marketplace. Do you believe that bills are written with you in mind or lobbyists? Do you think legislators (aka the govt) serve you or serve those who wish to decrease financial equality?</p>
<p>Government solutions to economic problems are nice in theory, but the reality is that they are driven by corruption.</p>
<p>Do you believe that the health care bill 10 years from now will seem like a great idea? Or, do you think that 1 pound of legislation wasn&#39;t actually written (or read) by politicians with our interests in mind, but was instead written by those will rob our country blind?</p>
<p>Libertarians may be self interested, but we also have an understanding that everyone is self interested, and that the govt is not used to satisfy the needs of the people, but instead to rob from those who do not exercise power over it, and those who have power over it are those with the biggest check books - for the most part.</p>

        <p>So of the 13 delegates, we were able to get 11 of our slate elected in the first two ballots. We also got 2 out of the three electors and the treasurer position. Then the nastiness started. </p>
<p>So two more ballots were not done. This is because to move forward to each ballot, the previous ballot must be completed by all of the other districts in the state. The next ballots were for alternate delegates - which some people running as delegates would be running for if they didn&#39;t get in as a regular delegate. Since the next ballots were contingent on the results from the other districts we were forced to wait, and wait, and wait. </p>
<p>Keep in mind we were the second largest district in the state, and we finished hours beforehand for the first ballots and dutifully passed on our results to the other districts. When the Romney camp discovered that we were mopping up the floor with them, they realized they had to shut this thing down. </p>
<p>They stalled the voting process in their district until 5pm, when the rules stated that the meeting had to be adjourned, and did so in their district. According to the rules we were not able to continue, and so were unable to vote for any of the alternate delegates (of which I was one ). We adjourned shortly afterwards. Two other districts were able to extend their time as well, but in the end they shut down as well (being the ballots could not be voted on without the results from the rogue district).</p>
<p>So from here it seems that the Republican Central Committee will be the one selecting the alternate delegates. I am none-to-hopeful about them selecting myself or anyone else on the Ron Paul slate as alternates.</p>
<p>In the end, we took most of the seats that mattered (the main delegates). As long as they don&#39;t find a way to take those from us, I will consider it a win. </p>
<p>Best of luck to the remaining states, and be ever vigilant. Opponents to liberty play dirty.</p>
