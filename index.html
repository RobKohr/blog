        <p>Do the imperfect.</p>
<p>Do that which is tedious in whatever way gets you through it.</p>
<p>Though it may suck, both the doing and how well you do it, it is far better than to not do the thing you are looking to do.</p>
<p>Everyone is always intimidated that the thing they want to do is populated by those who are producing such quality. Remember that everyone starts out at the bottom. (example: <a href="http://robkohr.com/articles/popular-youtubers---look-at-their-old-stuff">http://robkohr.com/articles/popular-youtubers---look-at-their-old-stuff</a>)</p>
<p>But remember anything is better than zero, and being persistently bad is how you get to be good. </p>
<p>To help, log, chart, keep records of how bad you are with whatever you are looking to achieve. What seems demotivating now will help remind you of how those minuscule daily improvements lead to greater things.</p>

        <p>I wiped out RobKohr.com as I haven&#39;t touched it in over 5 years, and replaced it with this blog. </p>
<p>It was built just using one long markdown file called blog.md that I edit in obsidian and each article is separated by ## Blog titles, and under that I use @date and @tags to specify those two values</p>
<p>I created a build.js file that reads that file, splits it into separate articles, renders the md-&gt;html, applies some extra rendering and css, and spits them all out into a large collection of individual files. This makes for a very simple light weight site builder that is just serving static files. </p>
<p>Source code is here for those who want to do something similar:

        <p>Often you will get deep in some code and come up against a wall. After working through it, and reading some documentation, if you haven&#39;t figured it out, it is time to go to stackoverflow.</p>
<p>I have been on stackoverflow for a little over 14 years now, and while I don&#39;t answer a lot of questions (there is a lot of competition for that) I have a lot of questions that I have asked and have given me a pretty respectable score, putting me in the top 6% of users (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/101909/robkohr">https://stackoverflow.com/users/101909/robkohr</a>). </p>
<p>The best things to do, is clearly state the problem, provide <em>concise</em> code that shows the problem in a reproducible way, and then state what you would like to achieve. </p>
<p>Sometimes when I work hard at making a clear question on stack overflow, I end up figuring out the answer myself. This is kinda like rubber duck debugging, but instead of a rubber duck, you are talking to the internet.</p>
<p>Then you end up with being the person asking and answering the question and giving yourself double internet points... which is <em>oh so important</em> :)</p>

        <p>I kinda love going to a popular youtuber&#39;s channel, going to their videos section, and sorting by oldest. </p>
<p>What is now a polished producer of content that makes you feel intimidated to even attempt to make videos was once someone with a crappy camera, shooting in their back yard with a bad audio setup. </p>
<p>Everyone had to learn to walk before they could run. Whatever you do, that you are doing bad and are discouraged, know that failing is just the first step on the long road to greatness (or the medium length road to goodness if you don&#39;t want to overcommit yourself). </p>
<p>It isn&#39;t that you lack an innate gift that others have, it is simply that you haven&#39;t put in the focused effort over time to achieve. Just keep on grinding and leveling up, because remember, everyone sucked at first.</p>

        <p>Just remember it starts with Laby. </p>
<p>Just a word I gave up on trying to spell right long ago. I have never been a good speller, and I think I have a slight bit of dyslexia, so I never really saw the inner spelling of the word, but finally I just decided to split the word into pieces, and remember how the first part goes, and now it is easy :)</p>
<p>Anyway, I found this Labyrinth RPG game that is great for kids here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1916011551?psc=1&smid=A10N5GI8B3O43K&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1916011551?psc=1&amp;smid=A10N5GI8B3O43K&amp;ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp</a></p>
<p>and I am going to watch the movie of it with them, and then surprise them with the game.</p>
<p>Reading through the game, it sounds like it would make a great video game/VR experience.</p>

        <p>Consistency is what I have been progressing more to. It helps to have lots of ideas and passion, but to do something big: build strength, learning a music instrument, run for office, build a side project, etc, requires doing something every day towards that goal in an endless way. I am actually doing all of those things right now, while raising kids and working full time.</p>
<p>To achieve it all - each thing needs 20-60 minutes per day to care and feed a goal to reach maturity.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t beat myself up though. I just have a daily checklist in a markdown textfile, and I can see how many I do each day and try to do them all. I frequently fail, but I try to get done what I can.</p>

        <p>I have been working out using a google spreadsheet to track workouts. I aim to do a 20 rep max each week for each exercise that is slightly above the previous week. So far, it has lead to a nice continuous improvement... assuming I don&#39;t ever skip weeks. Each time I skip more than 2 weeks it pushes me back a little bit. More when I skip a month.</p>
<p>Using Wathen&#39;s formula from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum</a> for 1RM, I can calculate my 1RM from my 20RM, and I also use it to calculate my 10 rep max. After experimenting with it, I found it to be a really accurate formula as I tested it going down to 3 reps. </p>
<p>What this means for me is I can keep doing 20 reps as my target, and it will always keep my 1RM and 10RM improving. This is great as being someone in their mid-40s the strain on my body when doing lower rep maxes is not worth it as I frequently end up hurting myself with lower reps. </p>
<p>Based on the equation, an increase of just 1 pound in weight is equal to 1.64 pounds in 1RM. This means that I am increasing my 1 rep max faster by doing 20 reps than I would be if I was aiming on doing 1 rep.</p>

Right now the order is hard coded, and each component has its own property set. I am going to create a wrapper for the components that will take all of the properties they need, and then pass them down to the component. The display order for the services can then load all of them in.</p>

<p>I am attempting to do this to make bread at home to help with Ella&#39;s gluten intolerance. Apparently even rustic breads from the grocery store are very high in gluten from the sped up process of bread making that helps keep it fluffy and more shelf stable.</p>
<p>I am hoping that more traditional sourdough bread will have more broken down gluten protein.

        <p>I delved into svelte pretty deep to get a grasp of it. I decided to try to make a set of components similar to material UI, just focusing on form elements. </p>
<p>When it came to passing values, references, functions up and down the component stack, it just became much more difficult than doing it in React, which makes things pretty trivial.</p>
<p>I got hit with the feeling that I was just playing with magic that I didn&#39;t understand. </p>
<p>This past week I built two static sites for running my school board campaign using solidjs. It has some basic routing and property passing, so I haven&#39;t really given it a good trial yet, but so far it seems to be an easy stand in for React. I&#39;ll need to give it eventually the same sort of test I did with Svelte.</p>
<p>I have a desire to move to SolidJs to move away from some of the re-rendering inefficiencies and difficulties in passing values around in React.</p>

        <p>Start a timer and see if you can beat your all time score. Just listen and talk to them. Remember, every 10 seconds you are on the phone, they are losing out on harassing someone else - you are really helping a lot of people and costing them money, thus destroying a bit of their scammy business. I call it being a telemarketing speedbump.</p>
<p>Find out everything about their product, but be hesitant and hard to sell to, but eventually relent. The best are vacation or auto warranty scams because there are an infinite amount of questions you can ask and ask again.</p>
<p>You will move up their call center to their top guys that close the deal. Then when you are need to give them your cc or ssn number, make something up. For the cc, use the first 8 digits of a real cc as those verify that it is real and associated with a provider. I then write out the last made up digits so I can repeat them. Each time you read the card number, read it fast, and switch around the digits and mumble.</p>
<p>Eventually they will figure out that you have been fucking with them, and oh boy the series of curses that will flow out of them. Eventually they will put you on a do not talk to list. They will call you, some times go “oh”, or maybe be pissy and hang up.</p>
<p>I think the service that calls you is different then who you eventually talk to. They hire the robodialer company, and sometimes they hire another agency to do the initial screening. Then they have the low level person that gets all of your info, and if they think they got a deal (a sucker) in hand, then they move you up to the real closer.</p>
<p>It is fun, and I have some made up names I rotate through and how many kids and all kinds of stuff. I am never rude - maybe a bit playful. I am not mad at the low pay workers that are grinding at this.</p>
<p>It is really their entire business that I hate. Almost all of them are built to fleece gullible people out of their money. Travel deals, auto warranties, student loan debts, computer virus fakers, amazon false charges, etc are not real businesses. Some really try to get into your phone and computer to rob your bank accounts. Student loan debt companies try to get into your federal student loan system and become your debt collector, but never paying off your loan.</p>
<p>They are EVIL, and the only way we take them down is by patiently talking to them… forever! If just 1% of people did this and acted like convincing targets, and kept them on for 10 minutes at a time, their business models would crumble. If you are reading this, you are now part of that 1% army that needs to be happily agreeable (but sometimes act skeptical to reel them in) to save the other 99% of mankind from this plague that has beset us. Take up your phone and take up the fight. If you record the call, post it up to tictok, youtube, or whatever with the hashtag <code>#telemarketingspeedbump</code></p>

        <p>Being a fan of time travel movies, and my wife being a fan of romantic time-travel movies, this was an easy choice. This is a story of a girl who lost the love her life in a tragic accident, and getting a chance to go back in time to save him with at time traveling mix tape. The catch is that she can only go back to individual moments captured by the songs in the mix tape and only for the length of that song. </p>
<p>The love this couple felt for each other really got me in the heartstrings. If you have ever been truly head over heels for someone that you would be willing to throw your whole life away for them and even die just to be with them a little longer (or at least dream of that love) then this movie will be instantly relatable to you. This is not a cutesy Meg Ryan kinda romance. This one hits hard, and is amazing.</p>
<p>The time travel mechanic slice of the movie is also amazing as well. It is great with how limited it is, and the main character, with how deeply she is damaged with his death, and how much she wants to save him is reckless and not carefully logical with how she uses it, which helps create some pain for the audience, but in a good way, and the resolution of the what she chooses shows how she grows as a character and leads to one of the most satisfying endings I have seen in a movie in a long time.</p>
<p>This movie really has you connect deeply to her struggle, from the death that you can never get over, even when others are moving on, to the pain of having what you have be so close, but you can never quite fix things. </p>
<p>The lead character was deep, flawed, interesting, and so well formed that I could get a good feel on who she really was as a person. The boyfriend and sister also did a fine job, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Danny Glover pop up in this movie, and while old, definitely not too old for this shit. He plays a record shop owner, and general wise old man who dishes out some advice - advice that I found as questionable as the lead character found, but gosh did he do it in a charming way. </p>
<p>Anyway, go see this darn movie. It is currently streaming on Hulu.</p>

        <p>My mind gets such a buzz from taking an idea and spinning it into the concept for a game and then making it so (the last part being so ardurious that it rarely comes into being). This fun open ended thought process that then needs to be rangled by the realities of time and effort to actually make it real, and if you don&#39;t wrangle it well enough, and commit hard enough, it just gets stacked on the bin of ideas that never see the light of day (which is surprising considering that that hill is taller than any mountain in the known universe).</p>
<p>I love the work that I do, but hell if I wouldn&#39;t love to be just making my income making games instead... but for myself, not working at a game company. That sounds about as much fun as loving donuts and getting hired at a donut factory.</p>

<p>The actual samples of things the press actually show from the rejection list are things like math textbooks using &quot;What me, racist?&quot; and then having the student use racial bias data that is questionable to solve a problem. This is subtly pushing the racial focused narrative, and they are finding it in a huge number of textbooks, which clearly is a way of pushing a message into kids with a million little cuts.</p>
<p>The message may be right or wrong depending on your opinion, but even if right, it is wrong to try to indoctrinate a belief by sprinkling it throughout all coursework. That is propaganda and with the subtleness that they are doing it, brainwashing.</p>
<p>Also, note that the American Federation of Teachers president that shared a list of banned books retracted it, because the books were not actually banned and the information was fake.</p>
<p>This is much more nuanced, and there is a real problem that is being addressed. If conservatives were controlling education and trying to insert their message everywhere in subtle ways to little kids, wouldn&#39;t you feel pretty pissed off? It is tempting to indoctrinate the mass of future adults with your beliefs through little levers as they are a captive audience in the education system, but that is not a situation that should be abused for even righteous goals. Let them form their own opinions and just teach them the subject they are being taught.</p>

    <article>
        <p>I looked up 2000&#39;s music yesterday on spotify. I am a child of the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s and when I listen to music, I really lean heavy into those decades, and like most people when they hit middle age, they tune into the newest music on the radio, and feel that the music of their childhood is way superior.</p>
<p>We are now in the 2020&#39;s, and so the &#39;00&#39;s music would be basically retro today, as depressing as that sounds. Also, admittedly, I don&#39;t know any of the music except for a few hits from the 2000&#39;s, so I was surprised to be enjoying the mix, where I was hating the current top 40&#39;s.</p>
<p>Then I was hit with a realization... and probably a pretty obvious realization. </p>
<p>This realization stemmed also from listening to top 40 countdowns by year from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s... </p>
<p>Whatever the time period, most music kinda sucks. Those songs from your childhood - they were the cream of the crop; the ultra-fit songs that survived the brutal process of musical natural selection. There are plenty of them, but they only account for 5% of the stuff that was playing on the radio all the time. This is why you remember them. It was exciting when something really good came on the radio. </p>
<p>This is why the 2000&#39;s top hits mix is so much better than what is in the top 40 today, and even without the rose colored lenses of nostalgia. They are the ones that people made sure to include in the mix, and it is chosen from a full 10 years of music. Radio stations that are playing the newest hits, aren&#39;t playing things from 4 years ago, because it has become dated and it isn&#39;t hip, but when that music graduates on to a decades channel when those that are young and hip now become adults, they will continue the trend of thinking their music was the best.</p>
<p>Yeah, nostalgia makes the decades you grew up in warm and fuzzy. But go back and listen to music of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, eras you didn&#39;t grow up in, and that music is also fantastic, even if less familiar. It is simply that choosing the top 40 of a decade 10 years after that decade ends will result in a much better collection of music than if you are just choosing whatever is in vogue today.</p>
<p>This can be extended to movies, clothing fashions, cars, catch phrases, and anything. The stuff that was good enough to stick in your brain 10 years later has battled it out with whatever was cool at any time, and yeah it might have been played out at the time, you can be damn sure you are singing along and talking a yarn about how great it was today to your kids who just look at you as some senile old parent who just doesn&#39;t get it.</p>
<p>And thus the cycle goes on.</p>

<p>(There are also some other videos of him talking about creativity)</p>
<p>Creativity is derived from play.</p>
<p>We exist in one of two states: Open and Closed</p>
<p>Closed is for when creativity is decided on and should be the follow up to being open. Don&#39;t try to be creative when closed, focus on implementing - kinda like if you are doing a motorcycle jump, you don&#39;t want to be thinking of how to change it up when you are in the processes of making the jump.</p>
<p>The open system is where creativity flourishes.</p>
<p>It needs the following:</p>
<h3>Space</h3>
<p>A place carved out without any tasks to do.</p>
<p>When you are in this space, you will start out trying to think of all the things in life that you need to do. It will take some time to get over them, but don&#39;t engage with them. Don&#39;t try to complete any tasks in open mode.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>A set of time with a specific endpoint. This part is important. It isn&#39;t playtime without an endpoint to play. You need to have more than 30min to get life tasks out of the way though, so don&#39;t choose too short of a time. Also, it can be exausting to go for too long. Having 1.5 hrs should be the cap.</p>
<h3>Time (yes again)</h3>
<p>When you come up with an idea, don&#39;t just grab it and go with it. John talked about a fellow script writer that did this and that persons scripts were as fully realized.</p>
<p>Let the idea set and keep playing with it.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind there is nothing right or wrong. Throw out complete drivel. Good ideas are often the joining of two concepts that lead to something greater. But there are an infinite amount of bad combinations. Feel free to explore whatever, as sometimes bad combinations lead to great ones.</p>
<h3>Confidence</h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong and there is no mistakes. Let Humor rule as that can lead to great things. You can still be funny with something serious. Avoid being solumn. There is always room for levity in coming up with solutions.</p>
<p>When exploring ideas, just keep thoughts gently around the subject matter, but don&#39;t worry about being to tight. As long as it lightly is grazing the goal, it will settle back into what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Always be positive and avoid saying no... kinda like sketch comedy, you always want to give a path for more and not shut things down.</p>
<p>Phrases like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go on</li>
<li>can you explain that better</li>
</ul>
<p>He finishes off talking about how the japanese have meetings with no plan, and importantly let the junior people talk first. This way, they don&#39;t have to be in a position where they would have to disagree with their superiors.</p>

<p>Having a family, side projects, main work, hobbies, etc can just be too much to keep track of, and also to allot time to. How often do you say &quot;I&#39;ll do X around the house&quot; and you just never get around to it.</p>
<p>Recently I have fallen in love with Pivotal Tracker for work purposes in managing tasks, and have replaced my text based task tracking system with PT for my personal life. What is nice about PT is you don&#39;t decide what you can accomplish in a sprint, it tells you based upon the average of your velocity in previous sprints. You can resort the backlog to prioritize things, but the sprint end marker will still just envelope a certain number of points.</p>
<p>Put too many things in your sprint, and you might not get to the things you wanna do, but you can easily see that happen before the week starts.</p>
<p>To make things better from a planning point of view, I add 7 epochs labeled Monday, Tuesday, ...Sunday. I put them in the sprint so I can figure out what I am going to do that day, and mark the day as done when all the tasks are done that day.</p>
<p>Lots of labels are used for what kind of things that need to be done, and all this helps me balance work, fun, chores, etc.</p>
<p>The mobile app for PT is pretty snappy, and allows for the creation of stories without any details really quickly, and puts them at the top of the backlog, making it a handy todo list app.</p>
<p>You can also use PT workspaces to see a combined view of different projects and your personal tasks, but I found it more clunky, and just create clone of work tasks in my personal tasks project.</p>

<p>After working with typescript a lot on work projects, I typically skip it on personal projects as it just seems tedious at times.</p>
<p>Well, I just threw it into the neverall project while working on an alerting system, and by golly did it help clean up some things.</p>
<p>The issues I find are related to the type &quot;any&quot;, which seems like sacrilege to use in projects, and for good reason. In a big team, it is easy for an individual contributor to fly under the radar tossing any in all sorts of places.</p>
<p>The flip side of it is that the ROI on sorting out some type stuff is just not worth the effort. Yep, it might come bite you in the ass, but sometimes mitigating the risk just takes too long, and for personal projects, the in between of sometimes using any when you don&#39;t really care is nice.</p>
<p>Throw in other devs though, and banning &quot;any&quot; starts to look real attractive.</p>

<p>I wonder how long it took to create this script and how much it was don&#39;t virtually without the machine, and how much of it was done directly with the machine.</p>
<p>These are glorious self balancing machines that have perfected the challenging AI task of physical motion. It is important to remember though, that they have no understanding of what they are doing, and the amount of work to create this dance number was mind boggling.</p>
<p>I could see these things dropped in a battle field, given waypoints, and objectives to shoot anything that looks humanoid or moves. They&#39;d be dumb as dirt, but still very dangerous. It makes me want to think up what countermeasures would be effective ... false targets, traps they can&#39;t handle that humans have no trouble with, body shape camo, etc. Then there is the difficult task of taking them out as shooting at them would be marginally effective.</p>
<p>Other fun bits would be that they would be cheaper built and more mass produced in a war setting, but power consumption would always be a thing for them. The walking robot probably would keel over at 20 min, where the wheeled one could go much longer, but have a tougher time with rough terrain. Then there is the cost/benefit of using these vs just bombing an area. Bombs would be cheaper, so maybe this would be more of a semi-autonomous thing that went with a group of troops and kills would be more guided, and built around securing an area but without total destruction.</p>
<p>Communications with the devices would be key, so having soldiers close by and in the loop would be important. And of course, this tech, while impressive, will be easily replicated over time. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how forces fight against each other. Probably going after the living soldiers controlling the machines would be more effective then having machines just slug it out with each other, but then, having further tele-presense would be better, and then you come back to the distance =&gt; easier signal interference.</p>
<p>The paper-rock-sissors of future wars will be fascinating to those don&#39;t have to be in the thick of them.</p>

Yep, I am far from a graphic designer, and my needs are probably basic compared to professionals in the field, but as far a graphic editing ability compared to fellow programmers, I am pretty good, and I don&#39;t run up to any limitations in doing what I need with what it provides.</p>
<p>Each of the tools are detailed with many sliders and adjustment factors that are easily used. Layers work great as do transformations. The pen tool works great with different sizes and strength.</p>

        <p>A little over a decade ago, I went on a binge and made a bunch of web apps of various sorts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://editthis.info">EditThis.info wiki hosting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cueflash.com">Cueflash flashcards study system</a></li>
<li><a href="http://constantsail.com">ConstantSail pirate and trading game</a></li>
<li>And atari combat and astroids clones</li>
<li>A dice rolling program</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, I have built up a huge list of projects I would like to build, I get started on some of them, but then fail to get them off the ground.</p>
<p>Issues that I blame on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I also had a messy divorce and custody struggle that for a good 6 years encompassed all of my attention (and a good chunk of $money), making it pretty impossible to focus on anything else, and really got me out of my routine for doing side projects</li>
<li>Being overcommitted to work</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsturt/2015/06/11/decision-paralysis-why-its-prevalent-and-3-ways-to-end-it/?sh=1ad1dd1735b2">decision paralysis</a> - that big list of ideas is so big it has it&#39;s own organization structure. Settling down with one idea is really challenging<ul>
<li>I am ADD as all hell (like 100% on most tests)... hence the giant list of ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The startup to any project involves too much overhead to keep me involved.
Ok, I am working my normal job, and I am creating a new project: creating the css, the layout, the database, the authentication system, the different pages, etc, and by the time I get to the meat of what makes something unique, I am on to the next project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these bullets is &quot;resolved&quot;, the middle ones aren&#39;t really resolvable, but that last one, I think that is tackle-able, and able to be handled with my scattered mind.</p>
<p>So I created a website called <a href="http://neverall.com">neverall.com</a> (the domain name was from a <a href="http://mixmatch.com">domain name generator</a> I created called mixmatch.com that helps you find short domain names). I also created a single create-react-app repo for neverall.com, and am using it for a rebuild of the <a href="http://godotassetstore.org">godot asset store</a>. Instead of creating a bunch of domain names and a bunch of git repos and separate projects, I am going to build one site to rule them all, and everything will just be basically a &quot;subdirectory&quot; of neverall.com. This will have a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the basic site setup stuff will always be there, so it will be easy to just create a new directory and use the same common db for all of them</li>
<li>Improvements to the design and components can be done all in one place, and so everything gets a face lift (though I do like individual projects to have their own look and feel)</li>
<li>A little SEO hacking as projects on different domain names don&#39;t share page rank, so my projects don&#39;t really help eachother out much, except for interlinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point is an interesting one, as it is nice to tell people, check out someCoolWebApp.com instead of neverall.com/someCoolWebApp.</p>
<p>The thing is, both are things that can be done at the same time. Using nginx, I can point all of the domain names to the same code base, but when you go to someCoolWebApp.com, it will show you the same content as neverall.com/someCoolWebApp, and this can all be handled in the React router code (I use reach router, which is awesome).</p>
<p>Now, duplicate content on the internet is a big SEO no-no, and google will ding you hard for it. Also, all that SEO juice flowing to someCoolWebApp.com doesn&#39;t benefit the collections of other apps that I am building. ... except it can!</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls">Canonical URLs</a> are things you can put in the head of your site documents. They tell google where the &quot;real&quot; original content is, and so that real content gets the SEO page ranking rather than wherever people are linking to. So I can tell everyone all about someCoolWebApp.com, and they can all be lining to it, but really neverall.com/someCoolWebApp.com gets all the benefits.</p>
<p>Another side benefit is that since everything is in one repo, I can bounce around between directories, reuse components, and work on whatever I feel tickles my fancy any day without having to decide what repo to work on and just being stuck on that. I can start writing code anywhere for anything and it will be useable without needing to start up much or even finish anything at any time.</p>
<p>All in all, an experiment into ADD programmer side project productivity. Maybe I will update you here on the progress... or maybe I will just be creating things.</p>

    <article>
        <p>I have a bit of a thought that 3d printing boardgames would be great, particularly portable ones with
nice cases.</p>
<p>For sizing, I am thinking of basing it off of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216">iso 216 paper sizing formats</a>. Most people will think of this relating to the A4 printer paper size.</p>
<p>The reason for focusing on this format is that is a standard that works well with doubling. There are 3 sizings in this iso standard. A, B and C. For reasons that I am not sure I fully know, B is the biggest of the lines, and then C, and then A. What is nice about this, is if we use size B6 for a standard sized box, it is 125mm x 176mm, and A6 paper is 105mm x 148mm. This means the box will fall nicely inside the print sizes for most printers, and make it possible to print pieces beside the box so things can be printed in one shot, and A6 paper can be used as the print size for instructions. A6 paper can be made by cutting an A4 sheet into quarters, so instructions could be print on A4 and then cut into 4.</p>
<p>The boxes will have an overhang at the top so that game boards can be stacked. The lid can be a simple circle with a finger hole in the middle.</p>
<p><img src="2021-04-23-17-09-31.png" alt="Diagram with lips on 4 sides"></p>
<p>One issue is that with this being the size of a b6, two b7&#39;s couldn&#39;t fit inside since the lips would push up against each other. One way to remedy this is to only have two sides of each box have lips on that stick out on the sides like so:</p>
<p><img src="2021-04-23-17-24-28.png" alt="Diagram with lips on 2 sides"></p>
<p>So two half sized boxes can fit into a rim of a lower box and then they can tightly stack on top of each other.</p>
<p>Alternative idea: have no sides stick out, and then have pegs that stick out of the top of each lid that fit into holes in the bottom of the box above it. The floor thickness would need to be such that it can accommodate that.</p>
<p>This might be simpler, and as long as the hole sizes are big enough that they don&#39;t grip the peg below. This can create issues though as having holes on the bottom of models can create issues.</p>

        <p>One thing that I find that helps is to open up a text file and start typing what your thoughts are and be unfiltered (I sometimes look away from my screen so I don&#39;t proofread). Try and get everything out, and let yourself brainstorm.</p>
<p>Keeping it all in a conversation in your head creates too many threads to keep track of and you end up looping around worrying about this or that.
Then after that, I take the blob of text and try to organize it into categories such as &quot;issues to resolve&quot;, &quot;action items&quot;, … etc</p>
<p>Writing also slows down your thoughts a bit and keeps you from bouncing too much.</p>

        <p>This is a <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DannyWeinbaum/20191115/353349/Genre_Viability_on_Steam_and_Other_Trends__An_Analysis_Using_Review_Count.php">great article about what games perform well on steam based upon their tags (categories)</a>.</p>
<p>Some games like strategy war games, which I have a great love for, make great money, and there are also very few of them. Other games like puzzlers are plentiful and don&#39;t make much. He also goes into the normal lifespan of a game and its revenue stream which tapers off after 5 years.</p>
<p>There were so many good tidbits in there, and even a multipage spreadsheet of useful sales data, which is like gold now that steamspy can no longer function.</p>
<p>One thing that seems to really make great money is the tag &quot;moddable.&quot; Definitely not easy to do in something like godot (or anything else for that matter) but it seems to make a big impact on profitability.</p>

        <p>This is a great article about using subdomains vs subfolders for seo:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seoquake.com/blog/subdomains-vs-subfolders/">subdomains vs subfolders</a></p>
<p>I looks pretty clear that subfolders are the way to go.</p>
<p>With a single server with nginx on it, you can reverse proxy to multiple servers using the location /somedirectory tag.</p>
<p>I am pondering the idea of making a bunch of mini apps, and then having them all under one domain (maybe this one) and then using subdirectories rather than creating separate names domains for everything. As of right now, this site is just me talking to myself as viewership is basically nil.</p>
<p>As I am coming back to working on instaboardgame, maybe it should be under tentoncreations.com/fun/boardgame. Cueflash.com could go under tentoncreations.com/flashcards. Constantsail.com could go under tentoncreations/fun/constantsail.</p>
<p>Editthis.info/create_your_own_adventure -&gt; tentoncreations.com/wiki/create_your_own_adventure</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I might not want to do that with editthis.info as the content on there can be adult in nature, and would make it so google adsense wouldn&#39;t be allowed on the other sites.</p>
<p>This blog could end up going under /blog, or just stay at the root.</p>
<p>I was also messing around with <a href="https://wordoid.com/">wordoid</a> trying to come up with something shorter than TenTonCreations.com. It is a tough call as that is a pretty long domain name, but it is easy to spell, and I think sounds pretty cool. It also makes more sense then undrix.com or lagon.com (two examples of available domain names). The choices between short and meaningful is a tough one with domain names.</p>
<p>Some sites I am thinking would be good to build: a site for feedback.</p>

        <p>Just some thoughts I had after watching this video:</p>
<p>Simulation of a Nuclear Blast in a Major City</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo&ab_channel=NeilHalloran">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo&amp;ab_channel=NeilHalloran</a></p>
<p>Nuclear weapons are the reason we haven&#39;t had multiple world wars since WWII. The game mechanics of warfare changed when any major conflict could lead to complete annihilation on both sides.</p>
<p>All wars since then have only be proxy wars through countries that are not nuclear armed. It makes it clear why countries such as NK and Iran would like to have these weapons. It makes them essentially un-invadable.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the movie bedazzled. I could imagine someone war-weary after WWII making a deal with the devil to make it so no major war won&#39;t happen again in their lifetime, and the wish was granted with nukes.</p>
<p>I wonder how many lives were saved by making the cold war not a hot war thanks to nukes, and if long run the debt of saving all those lives will have to be paid in full plus interest.</p>

    <article>
        <p>I used <a href="https://icons.grommet.io/">Grommet</a> for a react project, and here are some of my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Things I like</p>
<ul>
<li>Works out of the box for most use cases</li>
<li>Nice for form elements</li>
<li>Gives a standard look and feel for the site without any need to work out details</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I don&#39;t like</p>
<ul>
<li>A grommet element is a wrapper for an entire dom structure that you can&#39;t directly style as it doesn&#39;t have any classes you can apply css to; a simple parent classname that you can have as a starting point would work wonders</li>
<li>The Box wrapper and other wrappers for grid layouts just reimplement html features but in a more limited and difficult to adjust way</li>
<li>It basically sucks for doing anything new stylistically (such as building a static landing page).</li>
<li>It&#39;s design is kinda bla and minimal as far as customization</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were to do a application in the future I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;d still use grommet for all of its components, but not it&#39;s layout</li>
<li>Create a thin layer interface over grommet that just passes down props. This way a mvp can be quickly pushable, but the styles would be easily updatable<ul>
<li>But more likely, unless styles don&#39;t matter at all, I would just do my own component library based on mocks as really stying components isn&#39;t too hard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well structured scss is really easy to manage, and while grommet is good for building quick and dirty UI, scss custom built ui components are better to build for a project that is going to be something that will be used for a long term project.</p>

    <article>
        <p>When doing react, I have on worked with CRA up until now. I just took over a next.js app, and when built and deployed, it is speedy, but didn&#39;t like some of the details of development:</p>
<ul>
<li>myApp/pages/page-name/index.js is how you create a route for /page-name. While quick and friendly, I prefer the following:<ul>
<li>Defining my own route rules in details with reach-router. I am just to particular about routing to accept the trade off of simplicity against customizability. Also, defining routes is simple, and it is good for rearranging things without renaming components.</li>
<li>I really don&#39;t like dozens of index.js files in my codebase. I prefer to call pages pages/page-name/page-name.js so it is clear by the file name what things are for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>making changes when development are a little fluky when it comes to live updates, css doesn&#39;t seem to live update nicely, and there are just too many times that I have to kill the server and restart it to see my changes. This is even worse because it all seems unpredictable as to if/when changes would appear and a little frustrating</li>
</ul>
<p>These are little nitpicks, and if CRA didn&#39;t exist, I would go with next, but I love the way CRA is more customizable regarding routing, and is just snappy for responsiveness. I also feel there is just too much gray area as to if something is being rendered on the server or the client, and as an ex-apache/php guy, I really am not a fan of worrying about server side rendering anymore.</p>
<p>The case where I would likely use next would be if I were building a static content based site where SEO and first page load times were everything. I also know gatsby is supposed to be good for this too, so I would do some side by side comparisons. Also SEO with react is pretty good as is.</p>
<p>In the end though, that isn&#39;t really something I do much of, so I&#39;ll be on CRA for the forseeable future.</p>

        <p>I have a problem with time wasting websites such as youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. I start going down rabbit holes that suck away my work day.</p>
<p>As such, I am putting all social media sites on a 7 day time out. I have added them all to my /etc/hosts file so that visiting them just goes to an error.</p>
<p>Also, installed the mac app called &quot;Time Out&quot; which every hour forces me to take a 10 minute break, during which I am allowing myself some time to work on my current task list, draw pictures, play piano, or write articles like this in my blog (the app covers the screen with a semi-transparent image making it so you can&#39;t click a mouse, but you can type, which is great a forcing what kind of things I can do).</p>
<p>The idea being that taking 10 minutes out of my day to unfocus from work will allow me to think a little more, and instead of distracting myself with social media, I can do something a little more meditative.</p>

    <article>
        <p>For the last few years I have been using cloudflare in front of editthis.info. On the 21st I dropped it, and saw an immediate decrease in average load times (from google analytics):</p>
<p><img src="2020-09-22-15-12-53.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This was without any changes to the system at all, and with about 800-900 active users per day.</p>
<p>Also, as mentioned in my previous blog post, in cloudflare&#39;s dashboard, it reports a massive number of malicious attacks that they have thwarted.</p>
<p><img src="2020-09-21-10-26-35.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These are either inflated numbers, or more worrying actual users who couldn&#39;t get past their overly vigorous captcha screening process.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how this effects user counts overall - some could be from the speed boast and some from lack of captchas. In either case, I won&#39;t be using cloudfront again. I am going to set up a simple nginx proxy in front of the website, and implement some caching there to help increase the speed even further.</p>

        <p>My wife and I went to Disneyworld for our honeymoon this month and it was fantastic. Due to pandemic fears, flights were super cheap, the disney resort was discounted and nearly empty, and lines were nearly non-existent at the parks. Most rides were about a 5 minute wait, with some of the more popular attractions taking about 30 minutes. Compared to a typical 1hr+ for wait times for major rides, this meant going through a lot of rides was a breeze.</p>
<p>Some downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Masks weren&#39;t pleasant in the Florida heat, but some light cloth ones worked out ok.</li>
<li>The parks closed early, so they were only open about 8 hrs, which means you can&#39;t be to leisurely about trying to hit all the attractions</li>
<li>due to social distancing, restaurants cannot handle many customers, and so getting reservations for everything is required</li>
<li>Most of the small food places were closed, and walking with food was not allowed</li>
<li>No end of day fireworks since parks closed early</li>
<li>No live shows</li>
<li>Apparently no housecleaning for the rooms</li>
<li>Small kids have to wear masks. Seriously, 2 year olds are being required to wear masks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upside of being able to practically have the park for yourself is great though, and worth the tradeoff if you aren&#39;t bringing little kids with you. We&#39;ll be taking them to Disney sometime after the world stops being ruled by hypochondriacs.</p>

        <p><a href="http://Editthis.info">EditThis.info</a> has long been overdue for an upgrade. I&#39;ve been postponing it for a while, and now that I have just finished a big move, a wedding, and a honeymoon in Disney (covid be damned), I am circling back on it.</p>
<p>Task list (this article will be updated as things are completed):</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Clone current server instance</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Remove cloudfront - it constantly causes problems, and I think it is blocking a lot of users worldwide that it considers &quot;malicious&quot;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Set dev.editthis.info to new server instance</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Add nginx with caching (this will hopefully fulfill the role of cloudflare better as I can customize it as needed)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> upgrade php</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> upgrade mediawiki<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Convert an absurd of dbs to the new mediawiki db structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Point editthis.info to new server</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way I expect a lot of hick-ups and course corrections, but EDI is a very active site despite it&#39;s poor network performance. I think it is reasonable to expect that with a bit of an overhaul I can achieve a 10x increase in usage, which would make it much more lively than it is now.</p>

<p>Think of it like a big box of board game pieces that you can pull out and start playing with.</p>
<p>To start with, you create a table, then you can either import in a prebuilt game, or you can
pull out pieces and drop them in, and you and others who have joined can start playing with them.</p>
<p>Only the table creator needs to have an account, and users can just join with the private share link that the creator provides.</p>
<p>Table creators can have up to one free table per account, and that table will maintain it&#39;s state for up to 1 week. If you have a subscription, you can have up to 5 tables and they will maintain their state for as long as you like. If you have a pro account, you can have up to 100 tables that you can manage, and you can set users to be admins of the tables. This is ideal for tournaments.</p>

        <p><a href="http://tentoncreations.com/a/Started-on-a-shareable-web-based-boardgame-system/">Last month</a> I made a doodle post of an idea for an instant online board game system.</p>
<p>Well, progress is coming along fast:</p>
<p><img src="2020-06-04-15-12-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So far I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a react site which directs <a href="https://instaboardgame.com/game/test">/game/test</a> to a test boardgame</li>
<li>Websocket connection where you can move around game piece elements</li>
<li>A component hierarchy where every piece type passes props down to possibly other piece types, to then load in the Piece component. This should allow for a rapid development of lots of types of pieces, as the details of each are just specifying what makes it different from a different piece. Examples:<ul>
<li>Chess pieces would remove other pieces from the board if you put one on top of another</li>
<li>Clicking cards will flip them over</li>
<li>clicking decks will pull a card from an array of cards and put it on top of the deck</li>
<li>clicking on a dice box will roll the dice, and there will be an area to manipulate what dice are in the box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A json structure for a game where piece components are specified, and the props that go down to them</li>
<li>A reducer coding system which will minimize the size of updates coming from connected clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Current tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Authentication</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Membership - allow access to premium games and ability to have more than 2 tables</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Create game table</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Auto save games to mongo</li>

<p>Certbot is the tool from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">letsencrypt.org</a> that lets you generate ssl certificates for your site without having to pay the likes of Verisign ever again. Basically I love the heck out of them for what they do.</p>
<p>Nginx runs on your server to redirect examplesite.com to localhost:1234 if you happen to be running your node express server on that port.</p>
<p>Now if you want to have a socket connection to your server to receive constant updates(for example if you are building an <a href="https://instaboardgame.com">online sandbox styled board game system</a>) you could use the npm module <code>ws</code> to create that websocket for your javascript code to connect to on some port, such as port 8080. This however will not be encrypted, and it will also be kinda ugly and not firewall friendly since it isn&#39;t running on a standard open port.</p>
<p>But you can run all that through nginx so that you get to have ssl encryption and also use the same port as your node.js express server.</p>
<h3>How to do it</h3>
<p>For the client side javascript, you can route your calls to wss://examplesite.com/websocket</p>
<ul>
<li>In the nginx config, set up the connection to close when header is set to &#39;&#39;.</li>
<li>create an upstream to your websocket port</li>
<li>add the /websocket location</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    &#39;&#39; close;
}

upstream websocket {
   server 127.0.0.1:8080;
}

server {
    server_name examplesite.com;
    location /websocket {
            proxy_pass http://websocket;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

# after this is just an example of the rest of the nginx config for a node server on 8675
# that has a static build directory (for react or whatever)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8675;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection &#39;upgrade&#39;;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
    location ~ \.(gif|jpg|png|js|txt|html|mp3|css|woff2)$ {
        root /root/examplesite.com/build/;
        expires 30d;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/examplesite.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/examplesite.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
</code></pre>

I was reading this BGG page:</p>
<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4550/1000-blank-white-cards">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4550/1000-blank-white-cards</a></p>
<p>And it looks like a fun game to play, especially with some jumbo index cards.</p>
<p>Some ideas for a good ruleset based on what I read in the forums:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of the first game, each player makes 6 cards and leave 4 blank cards. All cards get shuffled in. On subsequent games each player makes 4 cards, chooses 4 cards from archive, and also inserts 4 blank cards.</li>
<li>Each player draws 5 cards from the deck</li>
<li>The starting ruleset for the game is draw a card, play a card</li>
<li>If you have a blank card in your hand, you can turn it into a new card. New cards should have a name, a drawing, a type, and a description.

<li>The game ends when there is no cards left to draw</li>
<li>Each card is one of the following types:<ul>
<li><strong>action</strong> - do what it says and then discard it</li>
<li><strong>thing</strong> - modifies a player state (add/subtract from score score or giving a special ability). Place in front of you (keeper) or another player (giver)</li>
<li><strong>modifier</strong> can be played on things to change them - such as give them armor, make them bald, fast, green. Could change values of the card it is modifying</li>
<li><strong>new rule</strong> - change how the game is played</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Point values for things can range from -100 to +100</li>
<li>Actions are usually discarded after play</li>
<li>Cards can have suits (I am thinking colored stampers) and colors which makes it so they can be targeted by other cards.</li>
<li>No skip turn cards - seems to be the least fun cards</li>
</ul>

    <div id="date">@date=2020-05-14</div>
    <div id="tags">@tags=<a href="tags/react">react</a>, <a href="tags/programming">programming</a>, <a href="tags/guides">guides</a></div>
    <article>
        <p><img src="2020-05-14-14-46-05.png" alt=""> React hooks is what got me to actually like React enough to make it my primary web development framework (at least at this date). They break away from the ugly class based heavily nested object form of React, and make it truly more functional, while giving allowances for managing state in a stateless system.</p>
<p>The first thing to grasp about react is that components re-render with every change in the props that come into them, and thus every time they are run (which is every time an input changes), all internal values are wiped out. It should also be noted that internal hook state changes also trigger these re-renders.</p>
<p>The following hooks help keep all of this from getting washed away with each re-render so that your components can continue to function.</p>
<h3>useState</h3>
<p>This one you will likely use the most.</p>
<p><code>const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);</code></p>
<p>Sets a value for the initial state, and gives you something to update that state with <code>setState</code>.</p>
<p>Updating the state will cause a rerender, but the state value will be maintained.</p>
<p>Note that the left hand side of the equal sign is an array, not an object. state and setState are variables that you make up, and could be called anything, and it is really the order of the outputs from useState that causes state and setState to be set correctly. For example:</p>
<p><code>const [burgersAreDoneCooking, setBurgersAreDoneCooking] = useState(false);</code></p>
<p>Would be how you would track the state of the burgers in your cooking app.</p>
<h3>useContext</h3>
<p>This can be used to subscribe to a context value set higher up in the tree.</p>
<pre><code>function Grandparent() {
  const [favoriteColor, setFavoriteColor] = useState(&#39;blue&#39;);
  return (
    &lt;FavoriteColor.Provider value={favoriteColor}&gt;
      &lt;Parent /&gt;
    &lt;/FavoriteColor.Provider&gt;
  );
}
function Parent(){
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Grandchild /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
function Grandchild(){
   const grandpasFavColor = useContext(FavoriteColor);
   return (&lt;div&gt;My grandpa&#39;s favorite color is {grandpasFavColor}&lt;/div&gt;)
}
</code></pre>
<h3>useReducer</h3>
<p>Outputs a state and a dispatcher. The dispatch is a function that will call the reducer with the current state and an action, and that reducer then returners an entirely new object that is a mutation of the original state to provide a new state value.</p>
<pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0, otherValues:[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]};

function countReducer(state, action){
  switch (action.type) {
    case &#39;increment&#39;:
      return {...state, count:state.count+1};
    case &#39;decrement&#39;:
      return {...state, count:state.count-1};
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {state.count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type:&#39;decrement&#39;})}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type:&#39;increment&#39;})}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>useEffect</h3>
<p>This is run after the page renders, and if you leave out the dependency array, it will rerun every single time. Usually you only want this to run once though, so setting it to depend on some variables changing, or at a minimum, just passing it [] as the second parameter will keep it from repeatedly running</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(
  () =&gt; {
    /*Do something just once after rendering, unless depends array changes*/
  },
  [somethingToDependOn],
);
</code></pre>
<h3>useMemo</h3>
<p>Only re-run when the dependency changes. This is useful for expensive calculations. It can be used as a watcher for a dependency that will then cause a function to run.</p>
<pre><code>largestPrime = useMemo(
() =&gt; calculateLargestPrimeOfNumber(newNumber),
[newNumber]
);
</code></pre>
<p>This will update the messageHistory every time a new value comes in for lastMessage</p>
<h3>useRef</h3>
<pre><code>const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
</code></pre>
<p>Returns an object with a property .current that you can mutate whenever. The object will persist and so you get to keep access to current. This is sometimes used with</p>
<p><code>&lt;div ref={yourRefObj}&gt;</code>. When react rerenders the dom, it will reapply your object to it, and your yourRefObj.current will always point to the dom element</p>
<h3>useCallback</h3>
<p>Stores a callback on a variable so you can use it on children elements and won&#39;t cause a render of the children for every time the parent changes. Since in the below, the reference to onChildChange always stays the same on re-renders, it makes it so <Child> doesn&#39;t detect a change in it&#39;s passed in values.</p>
<p>We use &quot;a&quot; as a dependency so that the callback is updated when the state of &quot;a&quot; is updated.</p>
<pre><code>function Parent({ ... }) {
  const [a, setA] = useState(0);
  const onChildChange = useCallback(() =&gt;
   {doSomething(a);}, [a]);
  ...
  return (
  ...
    &lt;Child onChange={onChildChange} /&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Some others</h3>
<p>I skipped useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useDebugValue as those are rarely used. You can read <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html">the documentation about them here.</a></p>

        <p>Make hay while the sun shines.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think of this as a partly as keeping your eyes open to when the sun shines... which is when opportunities exist... and actually taking advantage of the situation. This is always a challenge because you have to act and act quickly, when it is so much easier to let the opportunity slide.</li>
</ul>
<p>A boy will dabble in a thousand pursuits and then drop them when he gets bored or they become too difficult. A man will always finish what he starts.</p>
<ul>
<li>This one I disagree with. I like to go with Adam Savage&#39;s style where he has multiple projects going simultaneously, and just jumping on what interests you, even if it means having a dozen half completed things. This makes it so something is always moving forward, you are following your passions, and you don&#39;t get into creative blocks. This only applies to creative pursuits, and for those, it is when you switch to another task, not when you just walk away from doing anything to watch tv.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make it your goal to have your children say about you what Theodore Roosevelt said about his father: &quot;My father was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Love this. It gives a solid list of traits to exemplify and be a role model for your children for.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we play&#39;em 10 times, they might win 9. But not this game. Not tonight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even when the odds are against you, remember that sometimes luck is on your side, and you can make some of your own luck. Sometimes you have to accept that failure is the norm, but going into an area where failure is the norm can provide major upsides and enjoyment and growth.</li>
</ul>

    <div id="date">@date=2020-04-09</div>

    <article>
        <p><img src="2020-06-12-08-35-31.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is roughly a reply to/inspired by <a href="https://dev.to/wuz/stop-trying-to-be-so-dry-instead-write-everything-twice-wet-5g33">Write everything twice, just not a third time.</a></p>
<p>This is really a heavy &quot;it depends&quot;. The goals of making it so you have one source of things to be debugged and modified are great when we are talking about a decent number lines of code (or more importantly conceptual pieces). The other side of things is that DRY pushes to creating modules/components/functions that are nameable sections of code that increases readability of the code. An example of this is to take 20 lines of code that does one &quot;Thing&quot;, and replace it with a function call to Thing() that contains those 20 lines. Yeah, you don&#39;t save anything as far as line count of code, but you make it so when reading things, you don&#39;t have to parse apart the functionality of that 20 lines, and you can test it and know you never need to think about it again besides calling it&#39;s name.
The DRY to WET side of things start to slip over to the wet side (pun intended) when the cost of making it DRY and the ongoing costs of the DRY structure is more then just leaving it wet. This typically comes from when over-engineering leads to a tower of babel like structure of things wrapping things wrapping things to the point where it becomes challenging to make a change:
Having to digest the stack to understand the inner parts to find out where a change needs to happen
Dealing with the unintended consequences of the change on other parts of the system (regression)
Being straight-jacketed by a structure meant to be general purpose using parameters, but doesn&#39;t quite match what you need and leading to further changes to the abstraction to meet the new need.
This last one is the one that leads to the most challenges and much of what the time is spent on large developed systems.</p>

    <article>
        <p>I started working with using index cards for writing ideas similar to the slipcard (Zettelkasten Method). I started working with 3x5&#39;s but found they were too small to write ideas on. Now I am using 5x8&#39;s. This works well, because I use them in portrait orientation and they fit in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XZ3B7F2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">box I got for them</a>. I also got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0784FP7BW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">heavy duty cards</a> that stand up well in the box and are nice to write on.</p>
<p>Here is the first card in the box. Instead of using it as an index, I am using the first one as a list of ideas for what cards could be; this is helpful as it is always the card that is visible in front of the stack.</p>
<p><img src="2020-03-30-16-17-51.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So far I have made about 15-20 cards, and most are ending up under number 4 (following the system, things under 4 would be 4a, 4b, ...etc) which is where software ideas go. I don&#39;t know if this is a great choice compared to always tacking a new idea or concept at the end of the stack. The downside might be that I am always inserting most of the cards at that point as most of my ideas are software ideas. The upside is that I can have them always together so I can flip through them to see what I wanna work on next.</p>

<p>Using a long notebook file has made it easier to keep track of what I need to do each day. On any day I grab things from the backlog, and stick them under the header for today&#39;s date. Then I checkmark competed items. Incomplete items just move to the next day (or back to the backlog).</p>
<p>Perhaps a react app for the phone would be ideal for this?</p>

The FAANG&#39;s of the world are doing us a big disservice. They filter out the best of the best programmers in the world, and then shackle them with 300K+ golden handcuffs to work on meaningless tasks on already developed products.</p>
<p>I was talking with a recruiter many years back about when Yahoo had a massive layoff. The following year, he was suddenly awash with jobs to fill with new startups that were created by these Yahoo employees that were in comfy jobs for life.</p>
<p>If one of the FAANG companies laid off their workers, we would have a huge tech boom as these brilliant people suddenly would be forced to either get another job, or create something new, and that percentage of people that would create something new would rock the world. We would have new innovations across the board in IT and other fields that they would apply their talents to.</p>
<p>Instead, they are building plumbing in a system that really is just in maintenance mode. Remember, 99% of the functionality of these systems that exist today was already in existence 5 years go for them. This swarm of high priced talent is basically just moving the needle about 1-2% per year to just stay ahead of any other potential competitor.</p>
<p>The trouble is that these companies are so successful, that they can burn the cash trapping talent, and still pull in billions per year. This grind for small returns is just a small line item compared to the flood of cash they all rake in.</p>
<p>So as weird as it sounds, I think the world would be so much better off if these big companies lay of the majority of their engineers.</p>

<p>I was talking with <a href="http://twitter.com/octagon_game_st">@octagon_game_st</a> about his game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.octagon.octomaze_demo">Octomaze</a></p>
<p>I didn&#39;t finish the demo, and well, I figured I should paste it in as I think it is a good breakdown of game design for a mechanics based puzzle:</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn&#39;t finish the demo, and it didn&#39;t entice me enough to go back in and do so, and I have been thinking about why exactly that is.</p>
<p>I always liked the game mechanics of the early nes games. They introduced a simple mechanic, and then for a stretch introduced no other mechanics, but just kept on increasing the difficulty in that one mechanic before it got really hard, and then once it got hard, the dropped the difficulty and threw another mechanic at you and repeated the cycle.</p>
<p>It seems you put a lot of the mechanics in the first levels (I only went up till the buttons with the wall turns), so you were giving a lot of the goods first without the users earning/trying at all, where the new mechanics should be considered the reward. Otherwise it is like they already know everything that the game is going to provide, and now it is just going to keep getting harder. The reward shouldn&#39;t be the puzzles, but the novelty of a new way to work through puzzles.</p>
<p>And ramp that difficulty up faster.</p>
<p>Example level plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanic level (just simple navigating a maze- then 2 levels of difficulty to very hard</li>
<li>another mechanic level - a level that mixes that with the first mechanic, then a really hard level with the two</li>
</ul>
<p>Then continue.</p>
<p>Keep in mind your target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile, so they want something engaging fast</li>
<li>Smart, or at least they think so, since they are choosing a puzzle game. Don&#39;t coddle them. Make them hate you and want to throw their phone within the first minute. If they wanted to just plod along, they would have chosen candy crush.</li>
<li>Distracted, so once they pick their phone back up and check it for cracks, and beat that 3rd level that shouldn&#39;t have been so damn hard, you give them a new mechanic to chew on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give them 3 mechanics (maze moving, buttons, then a challenging monster... not a simple one) and 3 levels on each making the last one of each pain inducing, and then hit them with a paywall to go get the full version chumps where the octopus will make you cry for momma, if you think you can handle it. Be a little rude, have some fun with the players. When you play test you should see them fluxuate between happiness and suffering.</p>

    <h2><a href="articles/angular-is-just-easier-to-make-most-web-applications-in-than-react">Angular is just easier to make most web applications in than React</a></h2>
    <div id="date">@date=2019-11-25</div>
    <div id="tags">@tags=<a href="tags/angular">angular</a>, <a href="tags/react">react</a></div>
    <article>
        <p>UPDATE: My feelings about this have changed quite a bit, a follow up article is to come. The summary is that React has gotten so much easier with React hooks that my recommendations here have changed.</p>
<h3>A little background</h3>
<p>I did about 5 years of AngularJS (not newer Angular) development, 1.5 years of React, and now about 1 month of Angular, so I know my around a little bit of the the first two, and now with I have touch a bit on the third (I consider Angular and AngularJS to be fairly distant cousins).</p>
<h3>What sets them apart</h3>
<p>My impression is that React is a tidy powerful, elegant, and well engineered project that can suit practically any need, but especially that of a very unique web application that needs to be tackled creatively and with very modular code. It really delivers on the promise of functional programming, and is a joy to code with.</p>
<p>That said, you have to do a fair amount of thinking and planning with React.</p>
<h3>Where Angular thrives</h3>
<p>Angular (and AngularJS), you don&#39;t have to think so much as just do. There really is not a huge variety in how you would slice up and build a web application with Angular, and that is nice when you are building 95% of the web applications out there on the internet. Do you need something with a load of interlinked web pages, where you can view data loaded from an API and occasionally submit some data back to said APIs. Well, then you have a friend in Angular.</p>
<p>The lack of thought needed in such an opinionated framework is that makes it ideal, and it satisfies so many application needs, because frankly, as someone who has spent most of his life building web applications used by millions of people, all the apps start looking pretty damn much the same when you break them down to their basic functional parts.</p>
<p><img src="donuts.jpg" alt="time to make the donuts"></p>
<h3>Exceptions: where React thrives</h3>
<p><img src="genie.jpg" alt="genie"></p>
<p>Exceptions to this are more application type apps: web games, gmail, facebook, slack, google docs, twitter, photo editing, experimental stuff, etc.</p>
<p>Basically things where the concepts of pages are meaningless, and interactions are fluid and different than the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> based web web apps.</p>
<p>I feel Angular and React can fullfil both basic CRUD apps and more interactive application type apps, but each are much better suited to their the specific app type with React being more flexible</p>
<h3>Top down vs bottom up</h3>
<p>Another little bit with the differences is with Angular, it seems to make more sense to build full pages from the top level, and then split them into components with services and you move through each of the pieces, where react you seem to build up more a lot of components to put things together.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I like React better, but when I just need to get the job done and do it fast, and the job is pretty straight forward, Angular is the tool I would reach for first.</p>

        <p>It is way too difficult to find a domain that isn&#39;t being squatted on. Take any two random words in the dictionary, put them together for a domain name, and some squatter will own it.</p>
<p>As painful as it would be to raise prices, a domain name should be $100 per year rather than $10. This would destroy squatters business model as it would price them out of spamming the whole registry. The registries of course have no incentive to do this as they would rather sell 10000 domains for $10 than 10 domains for $100, so my dream of picking a relevant domain name for a project will just stay that, a dream.</p>

I have a bunch of devices that use micro-usb, and as such I have chargers for them everywhere, but inevitably the tips on those cables start to fail, and devices have to be wiggled around and set just right to charge. On top of it, the devices themselves start to wear down at the charging point.</p>
<p>Well no longer!</p>
<p>These guys click together with some strong magnets, and start charging the first try after hundreds of connections. The ports no longer wear out in the devices, and I have yet to see the cables fail to connect and charge immediately. On top of it the charging cables become universal, so when I got a usb-c device, I just put one of the tips in, and now I can connect it easily to every port in the house (which is now fully converted to just using these cables).</p>
<p>They are fantastic, and you should go pick some up.</p>

        <p>My vive has died in all the ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>One lighthouse got so bad that if you faced it, it would totally lose tracking</li>
<li>The audiostrap headset snapped</li>
<li>The display often messed up and showed two images on one eye</li>
<li>One of the controller trackpads would not click anymore</li>
<li>And finally: The screen just goes black after about a minute of use. I tried a different hdmi cable and that didn&#39;t fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was reading a review that the new Vive that uses inside out tracking was performing very poorly regarding tracking, so won&#39;t be buying that as a replacement, and the Valve index is way too pricey.</p>
<p>So, it looks like the Quest is the machine I will be going with. This is nice, as I was never a fan of the cables attached to your head, and with <a href="https://riftcat.com/vridge">Vridge</a> those PC games supposedly can be streamed to the quest. This is great because I have bought a ton of VR games on steam, and have plenty more in my wishlist.</p>
<p>Perhaps getting back into VR development again would be fun too. Maybe git back to making a VR swordfighting game.</p>

        <p>Looking at much of the traffic on the asset store, and non-USA visitors seem to be a big part of it (China, Russia, etc).</p>
<p>To satisfy this market (and target them for SEO), I will do something relating to using the google translate api to translate the various assets and text in the site. Urls will be something like
/en/assets/tag1/tag2/SomeAssetName</p>
<p>and english will be the default, with a page that will allow you to switch to the other languages. Asset translation will be kinda lazy done for whenever it works best for processing. Also, a link to see original language (perhaps english) will be provided.</p>
<p>Handling tag translation will be tricky as that is part of navigation.</p>

    <article>
        <p>10/25/2019 is the day I started the Godot Asset Store, and so I am inserting this entry for that day. After creating my first godot app (the tutorial dodge game), and after years of dipping my toe into Unity but never making much of anything, I see great potential in Godot.</p>
<p>One of the biggest pain points is that there is no commercial storefront. Yes, there is a free storefront, and with many many great open source projects, but the majority of those projects are ones that were personally made to try something out as an experiment, or to suit someone&#39;s own personal needs to finish their own game, with little long term updates and support. Yes, there are great exceptions to that, but then there are many that haven&#39;t been updated in 2 years, and aren&#39;t even compatible with the current version.</p>
<p>The Unity and Unreal storefronts are lively bustling communities with thousands of assets updated frequently to suit the requests of people who purchase and review those assets. Throwing in a monetary reward for developers to keep there assets improving, maintained, and version compatible is a great boon for the assets and those who depend on them.</p>
<p>So, I am working on the Godot Asset Store with the goal of filling that need for Godot to help it become an equal to, and one day surpass the other game development engines, because I believe in it, and feel the gaming world (both developers and players) will be better off with such a well built engine in use. I am not much of C programmer, and can&#39;t contribute much to the core of the project, but hopefully with this I will be able to help a little. I have built many of web applications, and even some e-commerce for some big companies, and it would be great to put those skills to use for this.</p>
